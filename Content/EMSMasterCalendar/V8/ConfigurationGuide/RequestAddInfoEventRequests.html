        <p>You use the Request Event Info option on the Manage Events page to request information&#160;from the EMS Contact for a selected event that has been pulled into Master Calendar from an&#160;EMS database.</p>
        <ol>
            <li>From the&#160;Manage Events page, filter&#160;for the pending events that you are approving.&#160;</li>
            <li>Click the EMS tab.&#160;This tab shows all the events that have been pulled from an EMS database into Master Calendar via a connector.</li>

The email contains a "Fill out&#160;more info" link that the EMS Contact can click to open an Additional Info page on which they can enter or edit the requested information and&#160;then submit the information. This action essentially allows the EMS contact to work&#160;directly with the event in Master Calendar and prevents you from having to manually&#160;enter the information that you have requested from the EMS contact.</li></ol><![CDATA[   ]]><p class="title"><em>Email sent to EMS Contact</em></p><p><img src="../images/B_Configuration/MC_RequestAddInfoEventRequests_EmailSenttoEMSContact.png" class="PDFlarge" /></p><p class="title"><em>Additional Info Page</em></p><p><img src="../images/B_Configuration/MC_RequestAddInfoEventRequests_AdditionalInfoPage.png" /></p><p class="box-tip"><strong>TIP: </strong>Depending on how your site administrator has configured Master Calendar, after the EMS Contact modifies the information for the&#160;event, the event request may be set to a Pending status. An automated email would then be&#160;generated and sent to the Calendar Manager informing the manager of the&#160;modifications by the contact and the status change to “Pending” for the event. </p></body>
