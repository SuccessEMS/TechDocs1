        <p>You can generate a Manage Events List report, which lists all the events to which you have&#160;access as a Master Calendar manager. You can generate a report that lists all the pending&#160;events for all calendars to which you have access as a Master Calendar manager or you can&#160;generate a report for events with different statuses.</p>
        <ol>
            <li>From the Admin Panel, navigate to <span class="bold">Admin </span>&gt; <span class="bold">Events &amp; Special Dates</span> &gt; <span class="bold">Manage Events</span>.&#160;The Manage Events page opens. When this page first opens, the list of events that appears is a list of all pending events for all calendars to which you have access as a&#160;Master Calendar manager.</li>
        </ol>
