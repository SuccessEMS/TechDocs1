            <MadCap:concept term="V44.1" />Configure Event Locations</h1>
        <p class="Body">An <em>event location</em> is the location where the event is to take place. For example, if you are managing a calendar for a university’s athletic events, you could set up a list of possible locations for the event, such as the stadium, the field house, the sports arena, the gymnasium, and so on. When you set up a location in Master Calendar, you can also provide a hyperlink for the location. For example, if you are managing a university’s athletic calendar, and you add the football stadium as a location, you can include a URL for&#160;a webpage showing a map of the stadium. The Location field for an event can be optional or required, depending upon your Master Calendar parameter settings. This topic guides you in setting up new&#160;event locations, activating and de-activating event locations, editing event locations, and deleting event locations.</p>

            <li><em>To activate/de-activate locations</em>, choose from the&#160;<strong>Active&#160;</strong>or&#160;<strong>Inactive</strong>&#160;tab.&#160;</li>

            <img src="../images/B_Configuration/location2.png" />
        </p>
        <p class="box-note"><span class="bold">NOTE</span>:&#160;Additionally, you can edit the Name, URL, Address, Latitutde, Longitude, Hours, and Phone from this screen. Make the necessary edits and click Save.    </p>
        <h2>Delete an Existing Event Location</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>From the Admin Panel, navigate to <span class="bold">Admin </span>&gt; <strong>Configuration </strong>&gt;&#160;<strong>Locations</strong>.&#160;The Locations page opens on the Active tab, which lists all currently active event locations in Master Calendar.</li>
            <li>Locate the event location you want to delete on either the Active or Inactive tab.&#160;</li>
            <li> Click the Delete icon  next to the Location you wish to delete. &#160;If any sub-locations reference the selected location, a dialog box launches indicating the number of sub-locations that reference it. You must first delete these sub-locations before you can delete the location.&#160;If no sub-locations reference the selected location, a message prompts you to confirm that you want to delete the selected location.</li>
        </ol>
        <p class="box-tip"><strong>TIPS:</strong> You can delete a Location only if no sub-locations reference the location. If any sub-locations reference the selected location, you must first delete the&#160;sub-locations, and then you can delete the location.&#160;We recommend reviewing and editing&#160;your sub-locations first. </p>
        <p> If you delete an active event location, any current events that use this location are not affected. The deletion simply means that going forward, the location is not available for use.&#160;You can delete only one location at a time.  </p>
        <ul><![CDATA[  ]]><li>Click <strong>OK</strong>.&#160;A message opens confirming the deletion.&#160;</li><li>Click OK in the message.&#160;The list of locations is updated to reflect the deletion of the event location.</li></ul>
