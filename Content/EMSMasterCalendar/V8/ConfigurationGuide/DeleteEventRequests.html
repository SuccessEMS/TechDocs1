        <p>From the Manage Events page, authorized users&#160;can delete an event request of any status: pending, approved, or rejected.</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Optionally, filter the list of&#160;pending events.</li>
        </ol>
        <p class="title"><em>Manage Events Page</em>

        </p>
        <ol MadCap:continue="true">
            <li>Select the events you wish to&#160;delete.&#160;To select all events on the currently opened page for deletion in a single step,&#160;select <span class="bold">Title</span>. If you have multiple pages of events to delete, you must repeat this&#160;entire process on each page.</li>
        </ol>
        <p class="box-tip"><strong>TIP: </strong>To have Master Calendar automatically generate and send emails indicating the&#160;event status (approved or rejected), your site administrator must have set the&#160;default System Configuration settings for email: name of sender, SMTP server,&#160;and address of sender. If your system is not automatically sending and generating&#160;emails after you approve or reject an event request, work with your site&#160;administrator to ensure that the necessary default settings have been specified.&#160;</p>
        <ol MadCap:continue="true">
            <li>Under Actions, click <strong>Delete</strong>.&#160;A message opens asking you if you are sure that you want to delete all selected events.</li>
            <li>Click <strong>OK </strong>in the message.&#160;A message opens indicating that all selected events were deleted.</li>
            <li>Click <strong>OK </strong>in the message.&#160;The appropriate tab (Approved, Reject, or Deleted) is updated to reflect the deletion of&#160;the event requests.</li>
