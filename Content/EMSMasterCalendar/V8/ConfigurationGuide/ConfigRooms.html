        <p class="Body">Within locations, you can specify a <em>room</em>, which&#160;is a further definition/clarification of where an event is to take place. For example, if you specify a building as the event location for a chemistry lab practical, a room could specify a specific&#160;lab room in the building for that event. Your Master Calendar parameter settings control whether the room field shows for users&#160;under&#160;a&#160;Location. <strong>See Also</strong>: <a title="Default Page Configuration Settings" href="SetDefaultHomePgLayout.html" alt="Default Page Configuration Settings">Default Page Configuration Settings</a>.</p>
        <p class="box-tip"><strong>TIP: </strong>You should identify a room with a name or phrase that explains what it is, for example, desk, work area, stage, hall, pop-up booth, and so on.&#160;“Rooms” is the default label for rooms. To change this label to better suit your organization’s business needs, see <a title="Managing Default Settings for Master Calendar" href="SetDefaultHomePgLayout.html" alt="Managing Default Settings for Master Calendar">Setting Default Behavior for Master Calendar</a>.</p>
