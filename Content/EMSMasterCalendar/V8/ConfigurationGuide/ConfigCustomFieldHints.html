            <MadCap:concept term="V44.1" />Configure Custom Field Hints</h1>
        <p>A <em>custom field </em>is found on the Submit Event page in EMS Master Calendar.&#160;Custom fields supply additional information about events on the calendar for guests or users. &#160;As a Master Calendar manager, you can provide&#160;<em>hints</em> or suggestions about these fields&#160;to the user. For example, if you are managing calendars for a university campus, and one of these calendars is for athletic events, you might add a custom field that indicates where ticket pricing information is available for the event. This topic guides you in creating, activating/de-acitvating, editing, and deleting these custom field hints.</p>
        <p class="box-tip">TIP:&#160;When you add a custom field hint, you are adding to a global list, which means that any hint that you add can be made available for any event submission form.</p>
