        <p class="Body">An <em>Event Type View</em> is a grouping or collection of event types to help&#160;your guests or users to search for multiple event types in a single step, rather than conducting multiple searches for different event types. For example, if you are managing calendars for a university campus, you might group the event types of Freshmen Swimming, Freshmen  Track and Field, Freshmen  Soccer, and Freshmen Basketball under the Event Type View of "Freshmen Athletic Events." This topic guides you in creating, editing, deleting and&#160;activating and inactivating Event Type Views and viewing Event Type View history.</p>
        <h2>Creating a New&#160;Event Type View</h2>
        <p class="box-note"><strong>NOTE: </strong>You can only add active event types to an Event Type View. You may first need to activate an event type so that you can add it to a view.&#160;</p>
