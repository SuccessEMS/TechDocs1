            <MadCap:concept term="V44.1" />Install or Upgrade EMS&#160;Data Connector Service</h1>
        <p>Prior to installing or upgrading the EMS&#160;Master Calendar Data Connector Service, be sure the EMS Data Connector Script has been executed against the EMS Database(s).  (See <a href="ExecuteDataConnectorScript.htm">Executing the EMS Data Connector Script</a>.)</p>
        <p>The optional Data Connector Service for the EMS&#160;Master Calendar System can be used to create a connection between an EMS Database and a calendar in the Master Calendar system.  </p>
        <p>Data Connectors can also be used to import tab delimited and XML files (see “Installing or Upgrading the Master Calendar Import Service”).  The Data Connector Service must be installed on a machine that is connected to the network and is running every day.  The Data Connector Service is often installed on the database server or the web server.</p>
