        <h1>Introduction to EMS&#160;Web App</h1>
        <p>The EMS Web App is a browser-based interface to EMS that helps you to find and book an available workspace as well as schedule and manage meetings, events, services, and more.</p>
        <p>With the Web App (formerly known as Virtual EMS), you can empower your employees to self-serve for specific meeting or work spaces or give them the ability to request reservations for managed spaces. </p>
        <p class="note-box">Concept: The EMS Web App also runs on a mobile device such as a tablet or handheld. Due to the smaller screen size and resolution of tablets and smartphones, pages may display differently but most of the same functionality is still available.</p>
