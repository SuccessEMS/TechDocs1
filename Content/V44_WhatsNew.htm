        <h2>EMS&#160;Version 44 Overview</h2>
        <p>New functionality and feature changes are summarized below. Follow links to documentation for further detail.</p>
        <h3>Enhancements to&#160;User Defined Fields</h3>
        <p>User defined fields now allow dependencies. See <a href="EMSDesktopClient/V44/ConfigurationGuide/ConfigUDF.htm">Configure User Defined Fields (UDFs)</a> for more information.</p>
        <ul class="unorder-list">
            <li>
                <MadCap:annotation MadCap:createDate="2017-12-07T20:56:17.9331728-07:00" MadCap:creator="Megan.Laub" MadCap:initials="ME" MadCap:comment="All links in this section went to the same topic, so I put the link in the intro sentence before the list." MadCap:editor="Megan.Laub" MadCap:editDate="2017-12-07T20:56:43.4028544-07:00">Dependent</MadCap:annotation> User Defined Fields (UDFs)&#160;are triggered based on answers to&#160;List Type&#160;UDFs.</li>
            <li>Multi Select User Defined Fields&#160;are available for&#160;List Type UDFs. This&#160;allows users to select more than one answer to a UDF.&#160;If one or more of the Multi Select UDFs has a dependency,&#160;it will still trigger the dependent UDFs.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>New&#160;Booking-Level Check-In&#160;Option</h3>
        <p>This allows administrators&#160;to send notifications to users to remind them to check&#160;into specific bookings, and if the bookings&#160;are not checked into before the start time, they can also now be automatically&#160;canceled. See <a href="EMSDesktopClient/V44/UserGuide/EnableBookingCheckIn.html">Enable Booking Check-in</a> for more information.</p>
        <div class="box-note">
            <p><span class="bold">NOTE:</span> This new&#160;functionality replaces Building-Level Check-In.</p>
        </div>
        <h3>Enhanced&#160;Automated Report Delivery</h3>
        <p>EMS Reports can now&#160;be set up to run automatically on a user-configurable schedule and sent via email. See <a href="ServicesComponents/EMSAutomatedReportService.htm">Configure Automated Reports</a> for more information.</p>
        <h3>Enhanced&#160;Notification Rules</h3>
        <p>Notifications can now be triggered based on&#160;Setup Types.&#160;User-defined field dependencies can also trigger notifications. See <a href="EMSDesktopClient/V44/ConfigurationGuide/ConfigNotRules.htm">Configure Notification Rules</a> for more information.</p>
        <ul class="unorder-list">
            <li>Service Orders can now trigger notifications based on Service States,&#160;Groupings or Resources.&#160;</li>
            <li>New, changed, or canceled Bookings&#160;can now trigger notifications if tied to Setup Type(s)</li>
        </ul>
        <div class="box-note">
            <p><span class="bold">NOTE:</span>&#160;Excludes EMS Professional.</p>
        </div>
        <h3>New Web-Based Deployment Process for Upgrades or New Installs on Individual Workstations</h3>
        <p>With the new&#160;<a href="EMSDesktopClient/V44.1/InstallationGuide/DowngradeWebDeploy.htm">EMS Desktop Client Web Deployment</a>, the client is installed from a web page which is hosted on the web server. See <a href="EMSDesktopClient/V44/InstallationGuide/UpgradeInstruct.htm">Upgrade Instructions</a> for more information. </p>
        <ul class="unorder-list">
            <li>Installation of the client does not require administrative privileges.</li>
            <li>The client is auto-updated whenever the client package is updated on the web server.</li>
            <li>Easy switching from one database to another.</li>
        </ul>
        <div class="box-note">
            <p><span class="bold">NOTE:</span> The existing&#160;conventional&#160;installer&#160;will be also be available as an optional method to install the EMS Desktop Client, however the conventional&#160;installer does not support auto-updating and easy switching from one database to another. &#160;</p>
        </div>
        <p>In preparing an upgrade from EMS Version 43 to Version 44 or 44.1, administrators should note that the EMS Web Client has been discontinued after 43.&#160;OS X users will now&#160;have to use alternative methods to&#160;connect&#160;to EMS, such as Citrix environments, RDC Terminal Servers, and so on.</p>
        <div class="box-tip">
            <p><span class="bold">TIP:</span> The&#160;EMS Web Client&#160;(V43) is a browser-based version of EMS Desktop Client. In version 43, EMS offered&#160;a browser-based version of EMS Desktop Client, which was used for administering EMS on OS X and Linux-based systems,&#160;and on mobile Apple devices via Safari, Chrome, or Firefox browsers.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="box-tip">
            <p>
                <MadCap:concept term="V44" /><span class="bold">TIP:</span>&#160;EMS Desktop Web Deployment (V44+ and V44.1) is an alternative method for installing EMS Desktop Client locally on individual user machines&#160;</p>
        </div>
        <p>This solution is not a replacement for the EMS Web Client, but rather, it is an alternative to using Microsoft<sup>®</sup> methods of deployment, such as SCCM. Administrators can use it to host EMS Desktop Client&#160;on a web server, with the ability to push the URL to any EMS Administrators so they can download&#160;EMS Desktop Client&#160;without needing Administrative Privileges on their local machine.&#160;</p>
        <h3>Enhanced&#160;Room Optimization&#160;for Existing Bookings&#160;</h3>
        <p>Using this new option will cause the optimizer to take into account bookings that are already in EMS when finding rooms.&#160;This feature will only work with bookings in “Booked Space” status.&#160;Searching or assigning rooms after the optimization has run (or during pre-assign) with this option checked will also display the spaces as in use. See <a href="EMSDesktopClient_AcademicPlanning/V44/C_UG_Campus/Campus_UG_44_OverviewRoomAssignOpti.htm">Overview of Room Assignments and Optimization</a> for more information.</p>
        <h3>API Changes</h3>
        <p>All the above functional changes and enhancements have equivalent updates on the APIs and integrations.</p>
        <h3>EMS Web App Changes</h3>
        <p>The&#160;<span class="italics">Request Only</span> (“classic request”) mode for&#160;<a href="WebApp/B_44/B_Config/VEMS_CG_ConfigWebTemplate.htm">Web User Templates</a>&#160;has been removed. This mode remains available for unauthenticated users (i.e.,&#160;guests).&#160;</p>
