            <MadCap:concept term="V44.1" />Persistent Authentication</h1>
        <p>Persistent Authentication&#160;refers to the ability of the EMS Mobile App to automatically log users in so that they are not required to log into EMS Mobile App&#160;every time they need to access it. &#160;When using persistent authentication, a user's EMS Mobile App credentials will become invalid after a&#160;period of inactivity&#160;equal to or greater than the duration defined in settings.&#160;If not using persistent authentication, a user will be forced to re-authenticate after the duration defined in settings has elapsed, regardless of activity.</p>
        <p class="note-box">Tip:&#160;Users with persistent authentication will be prompted to log back in to EMS Mobile App&#160;if anything is changed about their profile in EMS Desktop Client on the&#160;<a href="../../../EMSDesktopClient/V44.1/ConfigurationGuide/ConfigEverydayUser.htm">Everyday Users tab</a>, such as&#160;Email, Password, External Reference, Network ID, and&#160;Security Template. If your remove a user's access to a process template, they will also be alerted when they attempt to use it, and then they will be&#160;prompted to re-authenticate.</p>

        <p class="note-box">Note:&#160;This setting&#160;overrides the token duration sent by SSO providers. If a user should leave your organization, you should manually disable&#160;his or her profile in EMS, otherwise the employee will have access to EMS Mobile App&#160;for the duration defined above.
