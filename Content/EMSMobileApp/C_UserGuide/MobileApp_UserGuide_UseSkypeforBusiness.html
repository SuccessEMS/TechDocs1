There are three deployment&#160;types for Skype for Business:</p><ul><li><span class="bold">On Premise:</span> This deployment for Skype for Business does not retain a token and requires authentication every 8 hours. As a result, you will be asked to sign in every 8 hours.</li><li><span class="bold">Online:</span> This deployment retains the token so only an initial authentication is required.</li><li><span class="bold">Hybrid:</span> This deployment has the same authentication method as the Online deployment.</li></ul><p>For more information regarding authentications in Skype for Business, please click here.</p></li>
