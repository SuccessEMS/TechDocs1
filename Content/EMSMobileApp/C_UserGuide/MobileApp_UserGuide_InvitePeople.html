        <p>When inviting people to your meetings, it is important to understand the difference between Attendees and Groups.&#160;<span class="bold">Attendees</span> are individuals who are invited to meetings. A&#160;<span class="bold">Group</span> is the person(s) responsible for the meeting.&#160;Your Administrator sets the label for the Group&#160;field, so the name may vary&#160;(in the example below, it is labeled "Customer").&#160; A Group can designate a <span class="bold">First Contact</span> to oversee questions, changes, and updates to the meeting (First Contacts are optional).&#160;<span class="bold">First Contacts</span>&#160;will receive notifications regarding any meeting changes.</p>
        <p>Concept:&#160;<span class="bold">Attendees </span>= Invitees. <span class="bold">Group </span>or <span class="bold">First Contact</span> = Meeting Organizers.</p>
