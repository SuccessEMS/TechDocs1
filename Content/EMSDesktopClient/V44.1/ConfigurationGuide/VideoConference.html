        <p>This&#160;section&#160;details the configuration of the necessary features, resources, rooms, and everyday user process templates to accommodate reservations or room requests that require video conferencing capability.</p>
        <p>For organizations that use video conferencing, additional configuration features are available to simplify the video conference reservation process, which typically uses a request /approval room request process. When configured properly, EMS searches for all rooms that have a built-in video conferencing feature and it searches for all rooms defined in the system to accommodate a video conference. Shown below is a reservation with a mobile video conferencing cart automatically added to bookings.</p>

        <p>You must configure the following types of rooms so the correct rooms and equipment display when users request video conferences in the Reservation Wizard (or the EMS Web App).</p>
        <ul class="unorder-list">
            <li><span class="bold">Standard meeting rooms that can accommodate a mobile video conferencing cart. </span>Room availability for this scenario is based on the availability of the room and on the availability of the mobile video conferencing cart resource pool. For a room to be displayed as available, at least one mobile video conferencing cart must be available for the time slot selected. If a user selects one of these rooms, a booking detail for a mobile video conferencing cart is automatically added to the booking after the reservation is submitted.</li>
            <li><span class="bold">A room or other location that can accommodate a mobile video conferencing cart. </span>The room is configured as an Override Description room type. Room availability for this scenario is based only on the availability of the mobile video conferencing cart resource pool. If a user selects this room, the user can enter a location. After the reservation is submitted, a booking detail for a mobile video conferencing cart is automatically added to the booking.</li>
        </ul>
