            <MadCap:concept term="V44.1" />Overview of Video Conferencing Configuration</h1>
        <p>For organizations that use video conferencing, additional configuration features are available to simplify the video conference reservation process, which typically uses a <MadCap:xref href="../UserGuide/ManageReqMangedSpace.html">request or approval for room request process. </MadCap:xref> When configured properly, EMS searches for all rooms that have a built-in video conferencing feature and it searches for all rooms defined in the system to accommodate a video conference.&#160;Shown below is a reservation with a mobile video conferencing cart automatically added to bookings.</p>
        <p>

        <p>You must <MadCap:xref href="ConfigRoomType.html">configure</MadCap:xref> the following&#160;types of rooms so&#160;the correct rooms and equipment&#160;display when users request&#160;video&#160;conferences in the Reservation Wizard (or the&#160;EMS&#160;Web App).&#160;</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Standard meeting rooms that can accommodate a mobile video conferencing cart</strong>. Room availability for this scenario is based on the availability of the room&#160;<em>and</em>&#160;on the availability of the mobile video conferencing cart resource pool. For a room to be displayed as available, at least one mobile video conferencing cart must be available for the time slot selected. If a user selects one of these rooms, a booking detail for a mobile video conferencing cart is automatically added to the booking after the reservation is submitted.</li>
            <li> <strong>A room or other location that can accommodate a mobile video conferencing cart</strong>. The room is configured as an <em>Override Description</em> room type. Room availability for this scenario is based only on the availability of the mobile video conferencing cart resource pool. If a user selects this room, the user can enter&#160;a location. After the reservation is submitted, a booking detail for a mobile video conferencing cart is automatically added to the booking.&#160;</li>
