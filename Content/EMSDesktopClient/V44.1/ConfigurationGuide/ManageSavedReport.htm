        <p>A <span class="bold">saved report</span> is a report for which the filter settings have been saved, or saved, so that you do not have to adjust the filter settings every time you run the report. A saved report always has an owner, and it can be a public report (available to all users in your EMS database), or it can be a private report (available only to the owner of the report.) You use the Manage saved Reports tool to edit or delete a saved report.</p>
        <p>To learn more about creating Save Reports, see <a href="../UserGuide/WorkwithSavedReports.html">Working with Saved Reports</a>.
