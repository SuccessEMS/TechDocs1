        <p class="Body">In addition to configuring core data items that are specific to your organization, you must configure settings that determine a variety of operational factors for your <MadCap:variable name="General.Product" /> installation, including user security settings. These settings determine the functions to which your users have access in your <MadCap:variable name="General.Product" /> installation.</p>
        <p>The Security menu under System Administration enables you to control security (what users have access to) by:</p>
        <ul class="unorder-list">
            <li>User templates (and processes)</li>
            <li>Users</li>
            <li>User security</li>
        </ul>
        <div class="TitleandImage">
            <p class="title">Security Menu</p>

            </p>
        </div>
        <h2>Plan Your Security Configuration</h2>
        <p>You can fine-tune security by configuring actions users should be allowed to take, information they can see, and rooms and buildings they can book. We recommend you configure security for EMS in the following phases:</p>
        <ul class="unorder-list">
            <li>Configure Booking Templates (for instructions, See Also: Configuring Everyday User Templates)</li>
            <li>Configure User Templates (and associate them with User Processes)</li>
            <li>Configure Users (using User Templates as needed)</li>
        </ul>

                <MadCap:dropDownHotspot>Concept: You Can Grant User Access to Categories, Processes, Buildings, Rooms, Statuses, and Queries by Group With User Templates</MadCap:dropDownHotspot>
            </MadCap:dropDownHead>
            <MadCap:dropDownBody>
                <p>A user template defines the categories, processes, buildings, rooms, statuses, and queries to which a group of EMS users has access. Instead of defining users individually and then configuring security for each user, you can configure a template and then assign all the users who are to have the same security settings to a given template in a single step. You can configure a user template entirely from “scratch,” or you can copy an existing user template, and then make the necessary edits to configure another template.</p>
