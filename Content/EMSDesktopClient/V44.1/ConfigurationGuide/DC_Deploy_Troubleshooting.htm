        <p class="NormalWeb_6">If you&#160;experience a delay&#160;on the "first click" of major functions within the EMS&#160;Desktop Client that's too long, there are a couple of solutions. One approach is to leave EMS running all day so that you only experience the first click delay once. Another approach, which is a bit more involved, is to&#160;run&#160;a function within .NET called NGen. This function&#160;pre-compiles .NET applications to make them load significantly faster and eliminate first-click delays.</p>
        <h2 class="Heading2">Run NGen&#160;</h2>
        <p class="box-note"><span class="bold">NOTE:</span>&#160;You must have installed EMS and you must have administrative privileges to perform the following steps.</p>
        <p class="box-warning"><span class="bold">WARNING:</span>&#160;While NGen eliminates the first click delay, EMS will not be adding&#160;it to our standard installation process; this is an optional workaround you take at your own risk.</p>
        <ol start="1" class="ol_1">
            <li class="li_5">Open a command prompt as an administrator. To do this, press the Windows key, type&#160;"cmd" without the quotation marks, position&#160;the cursor over "Command Prompt" as shown in the screen shot below, right click, and select&#160; "Run as administrator."</li>
        </ol>

        </p>
        <ol start="2" class="ol_1">
            <li class="li_5">At the C:&gt; prompt, go to the directory where EMS is installed. If you have conventionally installed EMS, then it's typically at the following location:</li>
        </ol>
        <p class="NormalWeb_8">cd \program files (x86)\EMS</p>
        <p class="NormalWeb_9">However,&#160;if you're using the web deployment option to install EMS, then you should find EMS at the following location:</p>
        <p class="NormalWeb_8">cd %appdata%\EMS2016\EMS</p>
        <ol start="3" class="ol_1">
            <li class="li_5">Press Enter and you should see one of the following (where [user name] is your Windows user name):</li>
        </ol>
        <p class="NormalWeb_8">C:\Program Files (x86)\EMS&gt;</p>
        <p class="NormalWeb_8">C:\Users\[user name]\AppData\Roaming\EMS2016\EMS&gt;</p>
        <ol start="4" class="ol_1">
            <li class="li_5">Type the following:</li>
        </ol>
        <p class="NormalWeb_8">\windows\microsoft.net\framework64\v4.0.30319\ngen install ems.exe</p>
        <ol start="5" class="ol_1">
            <li class="li_5">Press Enter and wait until the process finishes. It will take about 5 minutes. Ignore any error messages.</li>
            <li class="li_5">When the installation finishes, you can close the command prompt and run EMS.</li>
            <li class="li_5">If you install a new or updated version of the Desktop Client, then you have to run NGen again if you want to eliminate the first click delay.</li>
        </ol>
