        <p>After EMS has been installed on your desktop, a shortcut icon for the application is placed on your desktop. An option for the application is also available from your Start menu. You can double-click the desktop icon to launch the EMS application, or you can select the option from your Start menu.</p>
        <ol class="number-list">
            <li>Access the EMS application in either of the following ways:<ul><li>On your desktop, double-click the EMS icon.</li><li>Open the Windows Start menu, in the Search field, enter EMS and then select the EMS option.<p>If you are the first person to log in to the EMS application at your organization, a dialog box opens where you enter the information for the login server and database that your application is accessing. (These are set up during implementation.) After you enter this information, the EMS Login dialog box opens.</p></li></ul><div class="TitleandImage"><p class="title">EMS Login Dialog Box</p><p><img src="Images/DC_CG_StartingEMS1.png" class="PDFlarge" /></p></div></li>
            <li>As the EMS Administrator, enter “admin” in both the User ID and Password fields, and then click OK. If this is the first time that your EMS application has been accessed at your organization, a Registration dialog box opens. You must import the license file (License.lic) that was provided with your EMS software to register your application. See “Importing Registration Information”; otherwise, go to Step 3.</li>
            <li>Click OK. The EMS application opens. The main menu is open in the application.</li>

            <p><span class="bold">Note:</span>&#160;For security reasons, after you log in to EMS the first time using “admin” as both the username and password, at a minimum, we recommend that you change the account password. Ideally, you should create an entirely new administrator account with a new username and password. See Also: <MadCap:xref href="ConfigUsers.htm">Configure Users</MadCap:xref>. </p>
