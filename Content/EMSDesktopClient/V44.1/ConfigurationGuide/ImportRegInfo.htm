        <p>The first time that your EMS application is accessed at your organization, a Registration dialog box opens. You must&#160;import&#160;the license file (License.lic) that was received with the software to register your software. You can change the database that your EMS system is using.</p>
        <p>If you need to make any corrections to your registration information, contact&#160;<a href="mailto:sales@dea.com?subject=Modified%20Registration%20Request">sales@dea.com</a>&#160;or 800-440-3994, ext. 863 to have a license file with the corrected registration information sent to you. You can then import this license file to update the registration information.</p>
        <ol class="number-list">
            <li>On the EMS menu bar, click System Administration &gt; Settings &gt; Registration. The Registration dialog box opens. This dialog box displays the registration information contained in the license file: your organization’s name and address, the EMS edition (Workplace, Enterprise, and so on), the license expiration date, the limits for your software edition, and any additional packages for which your organization is licensed (for example, EMS Web App).</li>
            <li>If the registration information is correct, continue to Step 3; otherwise, if the information is incorrect, contact sales@dea.com to have a corrected license file sent to you.</li>
