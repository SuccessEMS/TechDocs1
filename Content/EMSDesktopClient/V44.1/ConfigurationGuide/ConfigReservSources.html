            <MadCap:concept term="V44.1" />Configure Reservation Sources</h1>
        <p>A reservation source indicates the origination of a reservation request, for example, walk-up, email, <MadCap:variable name="General.EMS&#160;Web App" />, and so on. You can specify a reservation source at the time that the reservation is being made in the Reservation Wizard, or at a later date. You can also specify the reservation source as part of the search criteria when searching for a reservation in the Browser. Configuring a reservation source simply consists of naming or describing the source.</p>

            <li>On the EMS menu bar, click Configuration &gt; Other &gt; Reservation Sources. The Reservation Sources window opens. This window lists all the reservations sources that are currently configured in your EMS database and that have a status of Active.</li>
