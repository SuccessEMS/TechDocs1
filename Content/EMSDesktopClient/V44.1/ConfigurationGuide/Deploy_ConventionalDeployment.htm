        <p class="NormalWeb">The conventional deployment method is delivered in a typical MSI file. This file can be run directly on a computer, or installed via an administrative push. Standard toolsets for working with MSI files can be used for deployment. If your organization already has polices and systems in place for pushing applications, this may be the preferred way to deploy the desktop client. If you are looking for an easier way to deploy the desktop client, see&#160;<a href="DC_Deploy_Web Deployment.htm" title="EMS_V44.1/Installing_and_Setting_Up_EMS/EMS_Desktop_Client/EMS_Desktop_Client_Deployment_Options/To_Use_EMS_Desktop_Client_Web_Deployment" alt="EMS_V44.1/Installing_and_Setting_Up_EMS/EMS_Desktop_Client/EMS_Desktop_Client_Deployment_Options/To_Use_EMS_Desktop_Client_Web_Deployment">Understanding EMS Desktop Client Web Deployment&#160;</a>.</p>
