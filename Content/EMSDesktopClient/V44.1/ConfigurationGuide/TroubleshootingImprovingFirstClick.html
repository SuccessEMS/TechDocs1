            <MadCap:concept term="V44.1" />Troubleshooting: Improving First Click Performance of <MadCap:variable name="General.EMS&#160;Desktop Client" /></h1>
        <p>If you&#160;experience a delay&#160;on the "first click" of major functions within the <MadCap:variable name="General.EMS&#160;Desktop Client" /> that's too long, there are a couple of solutions. One approach is to leave <MadCap:variable name="General.My Company" /> running all day so that you only experience the first click delay once. Another approach, which is a bit more involved, is to&#160;run&#160;a function within .NET called NGen. This function&#160;pre-compiles .NET applications to make them load significantly faster and eliminate first-click delays. </p>
        <h2>To Run NGen</h2>
        <p class="note-box"><strong>Note: </strong>You must have installed EMS and you must have administrative privileges to perform the following steps.<strong><br />Warning:</strong><strong>&#160;</strong>While NGen eliminates the first click delay, EMS will not be adding&#160;it to our standard installation process; this is an optional workaround you take at your own risk</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Open a command prompt as an administrator. To do this, press the Windows key, type&#160;"cmd" without the quotation marks, position&#160;the cursor over "Command Prompt" as shown in the screen shot below, right click, and select&#160; "Run as administrator."</li>
        </ol>
        <p>
            <img alt="" class="internal" />
        </p>
        <ol>
            <li value="2">At the C:&gt; prompt, go to the directory where EMS is installed. If you have conventionally installed EMS, then it's typically at the following location:</li>
        </ol> <p>cd \program files (x86)\EMS</p> <p>However,&#160;if you're using the web deployment option to install <MadCap:variable name="General.My Company" />, then you should find <MadCap:variable name="General.My Company" /> at the following location:</p> <p>cd %appdata%\EMS2016\EMS</p> <ol> <li value="3">Press Enter and you should see one of the following (where [user name] is your Windows user name):</li></ol> <p>C:\Program Files (x86)\EMS&gt;</p> <p>C:\Users\[user name]\AppData\Roaming\EMS2016\EMS&gt;</p> <ol start="4"> <li>Type the following:</li></ol> <p>\windows\microsoft.net\framework64\v4.0.30319\ngen install ems.exe</p> <ol start="5"> <li>Press Enter and wait until the process finishes. It will take about 5 minutes. Ignore any error messages.</li> <li>When the installation finishes, you can close the command prompt and run EMS.</li> <li>If you install a new or updated version of the Desktop Client, then you have to run NGen again if you want to eliminate the first click delay.</li></ol><hr class="mt-export-separator" /><p class="template:tag-insert"><strong>Page tags: </strong><a mt-export-translate="no">article:topic</a><a>.NET 4.5.2</a><a>Slowness</a><a>NGen</a><a>.cmd prompt</a></p></body>
