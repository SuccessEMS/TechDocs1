            <MadCap:concept term="V44.1" />Configuring Building Hours</h1>
        <p class="Body">By configuring building hours, you can set times when buildings and rooms therein are not available for scheduling.&#160;</p>
        <p>In the <MadCap:variable name="General.EMS&#160;Desktop Client" />, configured building hours do not prevent a user from scheduling events outside these hours. A user is merely warned that the event is being scheduled outside normal operating hours. In <MadCap:variable name="General.EMS&#160;Web App" />, users cannot schedule events outside the configured building hours. Setup and teardown hours must also fall within the configured building hours for an event that is scheduled in <MadCap:variable name="General.EMS&#160;Web App" />.</p>
        <p>By default, when you configure&#160;a building, the building hours are set to Open All Day, which means that the building is open 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, 365 days a year. If needed, you can configure the hours for a building so that a building is open only for a specified time period on a particular date or for a given date range. You can also configure the hours so that a building is closed all day. You can configure&#160;the hours for a building for a single date, or you can configure&#160;the hours for multiple dates in a single step.</p>
