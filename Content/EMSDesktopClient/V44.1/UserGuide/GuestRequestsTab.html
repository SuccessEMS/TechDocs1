            <MadCap:concept term="V44.1" />Guest Requests Tab</h1>
        <p>The Guest Requests tab displays requests for space that require supervisory approval. Such requests are submitted through EMS Web App using process templates designated for "Unauthenticated Users."&#160;An unprocessed&#160;request is in&#160;Pending&#160;status.</p>
        <p>Once your system administrator has&#160;configured facilities&#160;(rooms, categories, services, resources, and so on), he or she can configure special process templates for "managed space," which is meeting space that may require additional oversight and an approval process to finalize a reservation. For example, your organization may need specialized space like the President's Conference room, or a large banquet hall, to be treated&#160;as managed space to ensure that any request to use it is approved by a supervisor.&#160;Typically, managed space involves services, expenses, and invoicing that affect&#160;multiple stakeholders and departments, and templates designed for this model are typically assigned to Everyday Users of EMS Web App. By contrast, such templates are&#160;not&#160;available for EMS for Outlook&#160;users since Microsoft<sup>®</sup> Outlook does not show the&#160;request status&#160;of such a reservation.&#160;</p>

        <p>The tab&#160;enables you to filter the&#160;list by status, building, room, and&#160;to work with the requests. If you filter the list by Status or Building (on the left panel), click&#160;Refresh.</p>
