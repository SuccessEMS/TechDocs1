        <p>The term&#160;drawing&#160;is used to describe a file (text-based or image file) that you can&#160;add&#160;to a booking. The file can stored on your organization's network, or you can create a drawing "on the fly" in the default drawing program on your EMS client, and then&#160;add&#160;it to a booking. Typically, a drawing is a setup diagram of the booking room. You can also&#160;detach&#160;a drawing from a booking, and&#160;view&#160;and&#160;edit&#160;a drawing.</p>
