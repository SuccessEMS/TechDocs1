        <p>EMS is able to send reports daily to selected email addresses. Reports that can currently be automated to send are Reservation and Sales\Statistics Queries and all Saved&#160;Daily and Statistics Reports under the EMS Reports menu. To learn more read about creating&#160;<a href="WorkwithQuery.html" title="Working with a Query" alt="Working with a Query">Queries</a>&#160;or&#160;<a href="WorkwithSavedReports.html" title="Working with Saved Reports" alt="Working with Saved Reports">Saved Reports</a>.&#160;Automated Reports can be set up and emailed to selected individuals. Automated Reports use predefined&#160;Queries&#160;and Saved Reports. An email will be sent to the users defined in the Automated Report Delivery with either the information requested through the report, or with an email stating there was no data to display.</p>
        <p>For Automated Reports to be sent,&#160;the EMS Automated Report service needs to be installed and configured. For directions on installing and configuring&#160;the service see the&#160;<a href="../../../ServicesComponents/EMSAutomatedReportService.htm" title="Installing the EMS Automated Report Service" alt="Installing the EMS Automated Report Service">Installing&#160;the EMS Automated Report Service</a>.</p>
