            <MadCap:concept term="V44.1" />Work with a Query</h1>
        <p>A&#160;query&#160;is the primary mechanism for retrieving information from a database. A query consists of questions that are presented to the database in a predefined format. A Query Builder function is available from the Reports menu. You can use this function to&#160;create&#160;queries for retrieving information from your EMS database. When you create a query, you can name and save the query so that you can run the query at any time that you choose. You can create a query from a newly created query,&#160;or you can create a query by copying an existing query and editing the copied query as needed. You can also edit&#160;a query, delete&#160;a query, and view&#160;and print&#160;a query's filters.</p>
        <p>This topic provides information about the following:</p>
