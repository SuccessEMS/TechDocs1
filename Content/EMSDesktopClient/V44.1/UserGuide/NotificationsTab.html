        <p>Your Administrator can automate alerts&#160;to be sent to you (or groups of which you are a member) when changes or additions have been made in EMS for bookings and reservations,&#160;service orders, room types,&#160;setup types,&#160;user accounts, and so on. When you create a reservation or booking that has these&#160;notifications turned on, users will receive these alerts without requiring additional effort from you. Be sure to review these notification settings during the process of creating or modifying events.&#160;</p>
        <p>If your EMS Web App implementation uses the&#160;<a href="#s3321" title="Integration to Microsoft Exchange Enables You to Use Outlook" alt="Integration to Microsoft Exchange Enables You to Use Outlook">Integration with Exchange</a>, you can handle notifications using Outlook.</p>

            <li>Select a notification and then click&#160;Go To&#160;to open the item to which the notification refers.</li>
            <li>If the notification is attached to a reservation, booking, or booking detail, then the reservation opens in the Navigator, and the appropriate folder (Reservation, Booking, or Booking Detail) is automatically selected.</li>
            <li>If the notification is attached to a group, then the Group window opens with the group information displayed in the window.</li>
            <li>Click&#160;Refresh&#160;to check for notifications that have been issued since you opened the Dashboard.</li>
