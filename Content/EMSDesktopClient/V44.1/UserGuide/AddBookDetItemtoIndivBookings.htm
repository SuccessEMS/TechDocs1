            <MadCap:concept term="V44.1" />Add Booking Details and Items to Individual Bookings</h1>
        <p>The steps that you follow to add booking details and items to individual bookings depend on the category type. Also, you can add multiple occurrences of a booking detail to a booking only if the booking detail is a Resource with Service Order category or a Catering category. If the booking detail is&#160;not&#160;a Resource with Service Order category or a Catering category, and the detail is already added to a booking, you cannot add the detail again to the booking. You can, however, add more items to the booking detail.</p>
