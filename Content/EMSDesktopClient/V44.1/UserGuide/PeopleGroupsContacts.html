                <p>A&#160;group&#160;is an entity for which reservations are made at your facilities. A group is one of the four core data items that your EMS administrator must&#160;configure&#160;so that you can make reservations. A group can be an internal or external entity and it can be an organization or an individual. A&#160;contact&#160;is a person who serves as the coordinator or focal point for a group.</p>
                <p>Concept:&#160;Attendees= Invitees; Group = Meeting Organizers</p>
                <p>Attendees get invited, and groups and/or first contacts get notices about changes to the meeting on the Dashboard. Additionally, your Administrator sets the label for the&#160;Group&#160;field, so the name may vary; in the example below, it is labeled "Customer." A Group is responsible for the meeting, and can designate a First Contact to oversee questions, changes, and updates to the meeting.&#160;</p>
