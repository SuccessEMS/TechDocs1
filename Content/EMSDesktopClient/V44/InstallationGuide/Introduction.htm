        <h2><a name="Understanding"></a>Understanding&#160;User Types&#160;</h2>
        <p>There are two different user types in&#160;EMS.</p>
        <p>

        </p>
        <ol start="1">
            <li>Administrators:&#160;These users create and maintain the EMS application within your organization, and manage or approve usage of space. This user type may&#160;also include Service Providers (Catering, Audio Visual, IT Support Staff), Security, and Receptionist Staff. These users will primarily use the EMS Desktop Client.</li>
            <li>
                <MadCap:concept term="V44" />Web Users:&#160;This is a majority of the users in the organization. Web users are&#160;typically requesting rooms and services. These users do not use the EMS&#160;Desktop Client, they will primarily use the web-based application, VEMS in V44 or EMS Web App in V44.1.</li>
        </ol>
        <h2><a name="EMS"></a>EMS System Architecture</h2>
        <p>The EMS Desktop Client is the foundation for a broad range of components,&#160;services, web applications, APIs, add-ons, and integrations.</p>
        <p>

        <h2 class="Heading2"><a name="Upgrading"></a>Upgrading?&#160;</h2>
        <p>If you are upgrading to a newer version of EMS, please encourage users at your facility to read the release notes&#160;before they begin working with the new version of the software. Doing so will minimize the amount of time it takes them to get “up-to-speed” with the new release and help them benefit from new features and functions that they might not otherwise discover.&#160;</p>
        <p>IMPORTANT:&#160;&#160;All&#160;the EMS-related components you have licensed&#160;must be upgraded with this release.&#160;</p>
        <h2 class="Heading2"><a name="Product"></a>Product Registration&#160;</h2>
        <p>Primary Contacts can obtain the license file from the Support Center area on&#160;<a href="http://www.emssoftware.com/" title="http://www.emssoftware.com/">www.emssoftware.com</a>.&#160; This license file is required to activate your EMS software and is required for new and existing customers.</p>

            <li>Configuration</li>
            <li>System Administration</li>
            <li>EMS Campus specific functionality or the Academic Import Utility</li>
        </ul>
        <p>**Please note that some discrepancies (e.g. differences in behavior and/or exclusions) will exist.</p>
