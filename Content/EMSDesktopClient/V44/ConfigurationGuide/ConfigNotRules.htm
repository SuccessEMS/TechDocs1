            <MadCap:concept term="V44" />Configure Notification Rules</h1>
        <p>Notification Rules determine which EMS users are emailed about&#160;additions or changes&#160;are made in EMS. You can set these rules to trigger for new or changed&#160;bookings or service orders, changes to VIP events, new web user accounts, or when specific&#160;UDF options are selected. Triggers are based on rooms, statuses, event types, group types, setup types,&#160;and/or categories.</p>
        <p>For a Notification to be generated, all the criteria in the rule&#160;must be met. Typically, notifications are an internal function for reservation schedulers and service providers, but when you are configuring a Notification Rule, you can specify the email address for whomever you wish to receive an Email Notification.</p>

                <p>EMS enables you to set detailed rules that trigger when notifications are sent to people and groups. This highly customizable feature guides you through a series of screens where you fine-tune your notification rules so that notices are more meaningful and timely, and so that notices automatically go to the right people at the right time. You can set your rules to trigger notifications for specific people, rooms, event statuses, and event types. Take extra time with this step and revisit your rules regularly to make sure they are continuing to serve your needs.</p>
