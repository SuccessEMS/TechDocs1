            <MadCap:concept term="V44" />Configure Override Rooms</h1>
        <p class="p_1">An&#160;override&#160;room&#160;is used in&#160;EMS&#160;to loosely define useable space which is not formally configured. For example, a building may have private&#160;offices which are not configured as spaces available for public use, but you may need to select such a space for an attendee who is participating remotely in a video conference. In order to provide company employees the ability to schedule meetings in these&#160;private&#160;rooms, Override Rooms can be configured in&#160;EMS.</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Name the space in a way that indicates an Override&#160;Room&#160;(for example, "Override&#160;Area 1”).</li>
            <li>Classify the&#160;room&#160;as "Override Description.”</li>
        </ol>
        <p class="p_7">In the example above, "Override&#160;Area&#160;1” can be used repeatedly to serve as a placeholder for any meeting request which will occur in an un-configured space.</p>
        <p class="p_7">For example on Monday a user makes a&#160;reservation&#160;for "Override&#160;Area&#160;1” and names it "Meeting in Mike Thompson’s Office”, and on Wednesday another user makes a&#160;reservation&#160;for "Override&#160;Area&#160;1” and names it "Meet Guests in&#160;Lobby Reception&#160;Area&#160;Prior to Building Tour.”</p>
        <p class="p_7">EMS&#160;does not track availability for events booked in Override Rooms; however,&#160;EMS&#160;reports on events that are scheduled in an override&#160;room&#160;as it would for an&#160;event scheduled for any other&#160;room.</p>
