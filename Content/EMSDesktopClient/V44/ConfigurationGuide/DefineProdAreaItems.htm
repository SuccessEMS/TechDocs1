            <MadCap:concept term="V44" />Define Production Areas and Production Items for a Catering Resource</h1>
        <p>You use&#160;production items&#160;to define the quantity of components that make up a resource. For example, a resource called Box Lunch contains the following productions items—sandwich (quantity =1), chips (quantity =1), cookie (quantity = 2), and bottled water (quantity =1). If an order for 20 boxed lunches is placed, then the kitchen must produce 20 sandwiches, 20 bags of chips, 40 cookies, and 20 bottled waters. To identify the areas of the kitchen that produce each item, you can define&#160;production areas. For example, the&#160;Delicatessen&#160;area might produce the sandwich, chips, and bottled water, and the&#160;Bakery&#160;area might produce the cookies. If a category has been defined as using production items, then at the time that you are configuring a resource for the category, you can define&#160;the resource as a production item, or you can manually define&#160;resources as production items for the category at a later date.</p>
