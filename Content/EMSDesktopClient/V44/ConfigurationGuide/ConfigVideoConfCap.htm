        <p>When you are configuring video conferencing capabilities you must first configure the necessary features and resources. After you configure the necessary features and resources, you can then configure the rooms, the override rooms, and the web process templates that are needed to accommodate reservations or room requests that require video conferencing capability. When you configure the rooms, one room type must use the built-in video conferencing resource and one room type must use the mobile video conferencing cart resource.</p>
