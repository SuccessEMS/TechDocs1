        <h1>
            <MadCap:concept term="V44" />The EMS&#160;Window</h1>
        <p>The EMS main window is your starting point for the EMS application. The window provides quick access to all the EMS functions (Reservations, Reports, Configuration, and so on) and system tools. This section is written from the perspective of EMS Enterprise; however, it is applicable for any EMS product (EMS Professional, EMS Academic Planning, and so on).</p>
        <p>The EMS Main window has four major components:</p>
        <ul class="unorder-list">
            <li>
                <MadCap:xref href="#TitleBar">Title Bar</MadCap:xref>
            </li>
            <li>
                <MadCap:xref href="#MenuBar">Menu Bar</MadCap:xref>
            </li>
            <li>
                <MadCap:xref href="#Toolbar">Toolbar</MadCap:xref>
            </li>
            <li>
                <MadCap:xref href="#Main">Main Menu</MadCap:xref>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>

        </p>
        <h2><a name="TitleBar"></a>Title Bar</h2>
        <p>The Server and database name that EMS is currently connected to will appear in the title bar across the top of the main window.</p>
        <p>
            <img src="../Resources/Images/DC_CG_44_EMSWindow2.jpg" />
        </p>
        <h2><a name="MenuBar"></a>Menu Bar</h2>
        <p>The menu bar is set up in a standard Windows menu format with menu commands grouped into menus (File, Settings, Reservations, and so on) across the menu bar. Some of these menu commands are also available in the main menu.</p>
        <p>
            <img src="../Resources/Images/DC_CG_44_EMSWindow3.jpg" />
        </p>
        <h2><a name="Toolbar"></a>Toolbar</h2>
        <p>The toolbar provides quick access to the most commonly used EMS functions. The toolbar buttons that are always displayed by default are the buttons for Book, Calendar, Wizard, Navigator, Browser, Web Reservations, Clients, Email, Dashboard, and Manage Services. Other buttons for other functions are also displayed by default depending on the version of EMS that you are running, for example, EMS Academic Planning or EMS Workplace. Some of the functions that are available on the toolbar are also available from the main menu. You can customize the appearance of this toolbar to best suit your business needs.</p>

        <ol class="number-list">

        </p>
        <ol MadCap:continue="true" class="number-list">
            <li>Do one or more of the following:<ul MadCap:continue="true"><li>To display the toolbar icons as large icons, select Large Icons; otherwise, click Small Icons.</li><li>To hide an icon from the toolbar display, in the Show Buttons panel, select an icon, or CTRL-click to select multiple icons, and then click the Hide button (&lt;).

To move all icons from one panel to another in a single step, you do not have to select any icons. Instead, click the appropriate Hide All button (&lt;&lt;) or Show All button (&gt;&gt;).</p></li><li>To change the order (from left to right) in which the icons are displayed on the toolbar, select the icon, and then click Move Up or Move Down as needed.</li></ul></li>
            <li>Click OK. The Customize Toolbar dialog box closes. The toolbar display is updated to reflect the changes that you made.</li>
        </ol>
        <h2><a name="Main"></a>Main Menu</h2>
        <p>Every time you open EMS, the main menu opens in the EMS main window. You can access the primary EMS system functions—Reservations, Reports, Billing, Configuration, and System Administration—from the main menu.</p>
        <p>
            <img src="../Resources/Images/DC_CG_44_EMSWindow6.jpg" />
        </p>
        <p>The main menu is arranged in a Windows Explorer-style folder structure. The top-level folders are the system functions of Reservations, Reports, Billing, Billing, Configuration, and System Administration. The available tasks for each top-level folder are further organized into subfolders. For example, to carry out a system administration task, you must first open the top-level System Administration folder, and then open the correct subfolder to view the list of available tasks.</p>
        <p>
            <img src="../Resources/Images/DC_CG_44_EMSWindow7.jpg" />
        </p>
        <p>You can always close the main menu by clicking the Close button (x) in the upper right hand corner of the menu. To open the main menu again, on the EMS menu bar, click File &gt; Show Main Menu.</p>
