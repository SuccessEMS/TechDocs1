        <p>Configuring EMS to work with Exchange Online (Office 365) or Exchange 2013 is the same as configuring EMS to work with a 2007/2010 Exchange environment that is hosted on your network.&#160;See&#160;this page&#160;to <MadCap:xref href="PAM_IG_SetupPAMImperson.htm">Set Up PAM Impersonation for Exchange Online (Office 365)</MadCap:xref>.&#160;</p>
        <ol start="1">
            <li>After following the steps above, access the PAM configuration area by opening a browser and entering the following:</li>
        </ol>
        <p>http://[ServerName]/PAMWebService/PAMConfig.aspx&#160;(replace [ServerName] with the name of your web server)</p>
        <ol start="2">

            <li>Select your email system in the&#160;Provider&#160;dropdown using the instructions provided on the page.</li>
            <li>Check the box "utilize AutoDiscover to locate the best Client Access Server for the user…”</li>
        </ol>
        <p class="note-box">Note: if you do not check this box, you&#160;MUST&#160;fill in the&#160;Url to Exchange Web Services&#160;field.</p>

            <li>Within the&#160;Authentication Information&#160;section, enter your PAM Account&#160;User Name&#160;and&#160;Password.&#160;The User Name should be prefixed with your domain (example – YourDomain\PAM Account, or Pam Account@YourDomain)&#160;</li>
            <li>(Optional)&#160;The “Use application pool identity…” option allows you to set the PAM Account credentials at the Application Pool level instead of storing the credentials in the EMS database.&#160;See the&#160;<MadCap:xref href="PAM_IG_ApplicationPoolIdentity.htm">Application Pool Identity for Service Account </MadCap:xref>section for more information about this option.&#160;If this option is selected, you&#160;must&#160;check the box to use Impersonation.&#160;</li>
            <li>If you selected “Exchange Web Services” as your&#160;Provider, select the checkbox if the account specified has Exchange Impersonation access to all mailboxes in your Exchange mailbox store.</li>
            <li>The PAM Web Service URL will be used in the&#160;Configuring&#160;PAM&#160;EMS Configuration&#160;section later in this document.</li>

        <ul>
            <li>Anonymous&#160;– No authentication</li>
            <li>Specify Account&#160;– Relies on a custom account (not the PAM Account) that you create and manage.&#160;Please contact Customer Support (or a member of the Professional Services group if you are working with one) to discuss the configuration process for this option.</li>
            <li>Default Credentials&#160;– Relies on security context of EMS application calling the PAM Web Service.&#160;If using this option, Integrated Windows Authentication should be enabled for the PAM Web Service.&#160;</li>

        <p class="note-box">Note:&#160; When testing PAM, the email account that is being used (either on the Test Settings tab or in the&#160;Testing PAM&#160;section below) MUST exist in the Exchange environment being tested.&#160;If you are testing PAM in a development environment please verify that a mailbox for the email being used exists in that domain/environment.</p>
