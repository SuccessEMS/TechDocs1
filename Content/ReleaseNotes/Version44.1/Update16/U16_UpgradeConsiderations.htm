            <MadCap:concept term="V44.1" />Upgrade Considerations V44.1</h1>
        <p class="NormalWeb">Before upgrading, please read the important upgrade considerations below.</p>
        <p class="note-box">Important:&#160;EMS Software recommends a best practice of performing an Internet Information Services (IIS)&#160;reset for all Web applications after updates have been completed.</p>
        <h2>EMS Desktop Client</h2>
        <p class="NormalWeb">Versions 11 and later of the Web Deploy Desktop Client will be required to upgrade to Update 14. This is due to a failure of the Web deploy to automatically update.</p>
        <p class="note-box">Warning:&#160;Do not try to manually update the Web Deploy using the AutoUpdate.exe. You will receive an error, "EMS is having trouble connecting," and the Desktop Client will stop working completely.&#160;</p>
        <h2>EMS Room Sign App (formerly Glance)&#160;</h2>
        <p class="p_4">As of Update 12, significant changes were made to&#160;the former EMS Glance product. The Update renames Glance to the EMS Room Sign App and also greatly updates the visual design.&#160;You may have to manually refresh the Room Sign App page on each tablet following your upgrade. To refresh the page on an iPad, you should close the browser and &#160;re-open it using the homelink. We are working to ensure you will not have to do so in the future.</p>
        <p class="NormalWeb">Upgrading to any release after Update 7 was causing end users to see an error message on the tablet. The browser on each tablet had to be restarted to eliminate the error.&#160;After upgrading to Update 15, end users will no longer see the error message.</p>
        <p class="note-box">Tip:&#160;This fix is possible because Update 15 initially turns off the any anti-forgery validation. To turn on this validation (and thus close the security hole), follow these upgrade steps:</p>
        <ol start="1" class="ol_1">
            <li class="li_14">Uninstall your current Room Sign application.</li>
            <li class="li_14">Install Update 15 to the exact same virtual directory.</li>
            <li class="li_4">After successfully installing, go into the EMS Desktop Client and&#160;Refresh All Units.<br></br><img src="../../../Resources/Images/V44.1 Release page/Before Upgrading Please Read_6.jpg" alt="RoomSignApp_RefreshAllClients.JPG" class="img_1"></img></li>
            <li class="li_14">Wait a few minutes for all the units to obtain the new settings.&#160;</li>
            <li class="li_14">Edit the Room Sign web.config file, and search for&#160; &lt;add key="ValidateAntiForgery" value="false" /&gt;.</li>
            <li class="li_14">Change “false” to “true.”</li>
            <li class="li_14">Save and close the file.</li>
            <li class="li_14">Refresh all profiles.</li>
        </ol>
        <h2>EMS Mobile App&#160;</h2>
        <p class="NormalWeb">EMS Mobile App Update 12 is compatible with Platform Services Update 12, as well as previous versions.&#160;Platform Services Update 12 is NOT compatible with previous versions of EMS Mobile App. Customers upgrading to Platform Services Update 12 must upgrade to EMS Mobile App Update 12.</p>
