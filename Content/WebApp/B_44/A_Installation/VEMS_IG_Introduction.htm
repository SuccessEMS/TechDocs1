        <h1>Introduction to the Virtual EMS&#160;(VEMS)&#160;Installation Guide</h1>
        <p>Virtual EMS is an optional, customer-facing web application that makes EMS available online. Virtual EMS provides an online calendar, streamlines the room request process and provides capability to support self-service reservations.</p>
        <p>If you are upgrading to a newer version of Virtual EMS, please encourage users at your facility to review What's New in Version 44 before they begin working with the new version of the software. Doing so will streamline the adoption of the new release and help them benefit from new features and functions that they might not otherwise discover.</p>
