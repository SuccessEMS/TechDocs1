        <h1>Modify Bookings</h1>
        <p>This section guides you in working with bookings in the Reservation Details&#160;page on Virtual EMS, where you can add, change, or cancel services and attendees for a booking. A Reservation may contain multiple bookings, and the procedures below also guide you in efficiently applying your changes to more than one booking within a Reservation.</p>
