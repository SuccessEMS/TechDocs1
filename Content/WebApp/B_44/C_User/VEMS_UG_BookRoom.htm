        <h1>Book a Room in VEMS</h1>
        <p>The <span class="bold">Room Request </span>page is organized into various sections to facilitate the&#160;reservation&#160;process—a When and Where pane (the left pane of the window) and two tabs—a&#160;<span class="bold">Location&#160;</span>tab and a&#160;<span class="bold">Details&#160;</span>tab.</p>

        </p>
        <p>You enter the information to search for available rooms in the When and Where pane and you view the results of the search on the Location tab. You enter information for the event on the Details tab.</p>
        <h2>Submit a Request for Space (Book a Room)</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Under <span class="bold">Reservations</span>, click a reservation option.&#160;The Room Request page opens.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>Note:&#160;Because VEMS is so highly configurable, the options that are outlined in the remainder of this procedure might or might not be present. In addition, certain labels might have been renamed in your implementation of VEMS. For example, “group” might have been relabeled to “client,” “employee,” or “department,” event might have been relabeled “Meeting,” and so on. Required fields are marked with a red asterisk (*).</p>
        <p>2. In the When and Where (left) pane of the page, do the following to search for a room or rooms in which the event is to take place:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Enter your date and time criteria.</li>
            <li>On the Areas dropdown list, leave the default value of (all) areas as is, or select a specific area to search.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Notes:&#160;Depending on how your EMS administrator has configured your organization’s, Room Request template, you might see different fields, or you might not see some of these fields displayed at all.</p>
        <p>Areas are available only in EMS Enterprise. Areas are not available in EMS Professional.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>On the Facilities dropdown list, select (all) buildings, or select a specific building or view to search.</li>
            <li>Select a time zone.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Tip:&#160;Multiple time zones are available only in EMS Enterprise. Only a single time zone is available in EMS Professional.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>If the meeting is a recurring meeting, then click <span class="bold">Recurrence </span>to open the Recurrence popup window, and then enter the necessary information for the meeting.</li>
        </ul>
        <ol start="3">
            <li>In the Setup Information section, enter your attendance and setup type.</li>
            <li>The Availability Filters section provides options for filtering your room results by Room Type, Floor, and/or Features. (You can click the arrow to expand/collapse this section.) If needed, enter additional filter criteria.</li>
            <li>Click <span class="bold">Find Space</span>.&#160;A list of rooms that meet the search criteria and that are available for the indicated reservation time are displayed on the List sub-tab (in a list view), on the Grid sub-tab (in a grid view), and if available, on a Floor Map view. In the List view, rooms that you can reserve are displayed under a “Reserve” heading. Rooms that you can request are displayed under a “Request” heading.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>Notes:&#160;It may be possible to specify the default values for some of these options, including the default view (List or Grid) for the search results. See&#160;<MadCap:xref href="VEMS_UG_SetDefaultValues.htm">Set Default Values for Room Requests</MadCap:xref>.</p>
        <p>A room that you can “reserve” is automatically booked for the event and no approval is required. A room that you can “request” must be approved by an EMS reservation coordinator.</p>
        <p>An option may be available to create a list of favorite rooms from which to make a selection. This list of favorites is displayed in the Facilities dropdown list on the Room Request page. See&#160;<MadCap:xref href="VEMS_UG_CreateListFav.htm">Create a List of Favorite Rooms</MadCap:xref>.</p>

You might also have the option of specifying the setup count for each room.</p>
        <p>Depending on how your EMS administrator has configured the room, an alert might open when you select the room. After you read the alert, click OK to close the alert and continue with room selection.</p>
