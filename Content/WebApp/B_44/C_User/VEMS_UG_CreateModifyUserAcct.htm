        <h1>Create or Modify a User Account</h1>
        <p>The VEMS Default page is the page that you first have access to before you log into VEMS or before you request to&#160;create&#160;a user account.</p>
        <p>This topic will provide information that will allow you to do the following:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <MadCap:xref href="#CreateUserAccount">Create&#160;a User Account</MadCap:xref>
            </li>
            <li>
                <MadCap:xref href="#Modify">Modify a User Account</MadCap:xref>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <h2><a name="CreateUserAccount"></a>Create&#160;a User Account</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>On the VEMS Default page, under my Account, click <span class="bold">Create An Account</span>.&#160;The Create An Account page opens.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>
            <img src="../../../Resources/Images/Using Virtual EMS (VEMS)/Creating a User Account.png" alt="vems_MyAcctMenu_image001.png" />
        </p>
        <ol MadCap:continue="true">
            <li>Enter the information for your user account.</li>
        </ol>
        <ul>
            <li>Required fields are marked with a red asterisk (*).</li>
            <li>The option to opt out of receiving automatic emails from VEMS refers to emails such as event reminders, the reservation summary that is emailed when you submit your reservation, and view or modify miscellaneous notes for the account.</li>
            <li>The code that you are prompted to enter is used to authenticate your request to create an account. The code is case-sensitive, and therefore, you must enter the code exactly as it is displayed. If you cannot read the code that is displayed, then you can always select Show another code.</li>
            <li>VEMS does not impose any rules on your account’s password; however, you might have to adhere to your organization’s standards for passwords.</li>
        </ul>
        <ol start="3">
            <li>Click <span class="bold">Save</span>.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>Depending on how VEMS has been implemented at your organization, one of two results is possible:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Your account is immediately activated.</li>
            <li>Your account is placed in a pending status and must be approved by your EMS administrator before it can be activated.</li>
        </ul>
        <h2><a name="Modify"></a>Modify a User Account</h2>
        <p>Your user account specifies your email address, your name, your phone number, your fax number, and your time zone. You can&#160;modify&#160;all these values. Your user account also provides the option of&#160;modifying&#160;your VEMS password.</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Under My Account, click <span class="bold">Edit My Account</span>.&#160;The User Account page opens. The User Info tab is the active tab.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>

        </p>
        <ol MadCap:continue="true">
            <li>Do any of the following:</li>
        </ol>
        <ul>
            <li>Modify any of the information for your account as needed—your email address, name, phone number, and so on.</li>
            <li>To change your password, enter your new password in the Password field, and then enter the exact same password again in the Confirm Password field.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Tips:&#160;If you log into VEMS using your network email address and you change your email address, then this new email address is the address that you must now use for logging in.</p>
        <p>Options might also be present to opt out of receiving automatic emails that are received from VEMS such as reminders or the reservation summary that is emailed when you submit your reservation and/or view and modify miscellaneous notes for the account.</p>
