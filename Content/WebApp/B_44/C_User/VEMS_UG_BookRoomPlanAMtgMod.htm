        <h1>Book a Room with the Plan A Meeting Module</h1>
        <p>The optional Plan a Meeting (PAM) module integrates VEMS application with your email system (Microsoft Exchange or Lotus Notes). If PAM is available, then you can find available rooms and add attendees for a meeting. Moreover, invitations are automatically sent to the attendees when you submit the reservation in VEMS. The Room Request page is organized into various sections to facilitate the&#160;reservation&#160;process—a When and Where pane (the left pane of the window) and two tabs—a&#160;Location&#160;tab and a&#160;Details&#160;tab.</p>

        </p>
        <p>You enter the information to search for available rooms and attendees in the When and Where pane and you view the results of the search on the Location tab. You enter information for the event on the Details tab.</p>
        <h2>Submit a Request for Space (Book a room with the PAM Module)</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Under <span class="bold">Reservations</span>, click a reservation option.&#160;The Room Request page opens.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>Note:&#160;Because VEMS is so highly configurable, the options that are outlined in the remainder of this procedure may&#160;or may not be present. In addition, certain labels might have been renamed in your implementation of VEMS. For example, “group” may be&#160;labeled to “client,” “employee,” or “department”; "event"&#160;may be&#160;labeled “Meeting,” and so on. Required fields are marked with a red asterisk (*).</p>
        <ol MadCap:continue="true">
            <li>In the When and Where (left) pane of the page, do the following to search for a room or rooms in which the event is to take place:</li>
        </ol>
        <p>Note:&#160;Depending on how your EMS administrator has configured your organization’s, Room Request with PAM template, you might see different fields displayed, or you might not see some of these fields displayed at all.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Enter your date and time criteria.</li>
            <li>Select a time zone.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Tip:&#160;Multiple time zones are available only in EMS Enterprise. Only a single time zone is available in EMS Professional</p>
        <ul>
            <li>On the Areas dropdown list, leave the default value of (all) areas as is, or select a specific area to search.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Tip:&#160;Areas are available only in EMS Enterprise. Areas are not available in EMS Professional</p>
        <ul>

            <li>If the meeting is a recurring meeting, then click Recurrence to open the Recurrence popup window, and then enter the necessary information for the meeting.</li>
        </ul>
        <ol MadCap:continue="true">
            <li>In the Setup Information section, enter your attendance and setup type.</li>
            <li>The Availability Filters section provides options for filtering your room results by Room Type, Floor, and/or Features. (You can click the arrow to expand/collapse this section.) If needed, enter additional filter criteria.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>Tip:&#160;An option might be available to specify default values for one or more of these options in any section in this pane. See&#160;<MadCap:xref href="VEMS_UG_SetDefaultValues.htm">Set Default Values for Room Requests</MadCap:xref>.</p>
        <ol MadCap:continue="true">
            <li>Click <span class="bold">Find Space</span>.&#160;A list of rooms that meet the search criteria and that are available for the indicated reservation time are displayed on the List sub-tab (in a list view), on the Grid sub-tab (in a grid view), and if available, on a Floor Map view. In the List view, rooms that you can reserve are displayed under a “Reserve” heading. Rooms that you can request are displayed under a “Request” heading.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>Tips:&#160;A room that you can “reserve” is automatically booked for the event and no approval is required. A room that you can “request” must be approved by an EMS reservation coordinator.</p>
        <p>An option might be available to create a list of favorite rooms from which to make a selection. This list of favorites is displayed in the Facilities dropdown list on the Room Request page. See&#160;<MadCap:xref href="VEMS_UG_CreateListFav.htm">Create a List of Favorite Rooms</MadCap:xref>.</p>

        </ol>
        <p>Tip:&#160;Your search is limited to the exact order of the characters in the string, but the string is not case-sensitive and it can appear anywhere in the search results. For example, a search string of&#160;ed&#160;returns&#160;Ed&#160;Smith, Ted&#160;Wilson, and so on.</p>
