            <MadCap:concept term="V44.1" />Email an Everyday User</h1>
        <p>Whether your organization uses Microsoft Outlook or SMTP, you can email&#160;an everyday&#160;user.</p>
        <p class="note-box tip">Tip: If your organization uses Microsoft Outlook, you can continue to use this email system to send emails to users; otherwise, to email a user using the SMTP option, your EMS Desktop Client user account must have an email address.</p>
        <ol class="number-list">
            <li>Search for the user whom you are emailing. See Also: <a href="WebApp_CG_ConfigEverydayUsers.htm">Searching for a user</a>.</li>
            <li>On the user's window, make sure that the user is selected in the lower pane, and then click <span class="bold">More </span>&gt; <span class="bold">Email</span>.<p>Depending on how your system is configured, either a pre-addressed Outlook email form or a pre-addressed SMTP email form opens. The To field is populated with the email address that is defined for the user, but you can edit this value if needed.</p></li>
            <li>Complete and send the email as you normally would.</li>
