        <p>Your Administrator controls what you are able to do and view in <MadCap:variable name="General.Product" /> using "everyday user templates" based on your user profile. The options and information you can see in <MadCap:variable name="General.Product" /> depends on your security access, user type, and many other administrative controls.&#160;</p>
        <p>Additionally, your capabilities are also controlled by your "booking templates" and permissions. To learn more about these settings, see <a href="WebApp_MakingaResv.html">Create a Reservation in the EMS Web App</a>.</p>
        <div class="note-box note">
            <p>Note: If you have previously used older versions of <MadCap:variable name="General.Product" />, you may know these templates as "Web Process Templates." These templates are now called "Everyday User Process Templates."</p>
