        <p>EMS for Outlook<sup>®</sup> is an optional (extra cost) purchase. If your organization has purchased it, then you will see the EMS plugin icon in your Outlook application. You will also see additional features and functionality in EMS. Furthermore, anywhere that you see people or groups in EMS, you will have access to everyone in your organization's email database (which is stored in Exchange Server). This means that you can see people's availability (Out of Office, Busy, In a Meeting, etc.), send them email invitations or notices, and add EMS events to your Outlook calendar.</p>
        <h3><a name="Finalize_Reservation_Details"></a>Finalize Reservation Details&#160;</h3>
        <p>The Reservation Details screen finalizes information about your reservation. Invitations to bookings and attachments will be sent to all attendees.&#160;</p>
        <p>Complete all required information and click&#160;<span class="bold">Save Reservation Details</span>, and then&#160;<span class="bold">Create Reservation</span>.</p>
        <p class="note-box tip">Tip: To add the reservation to your Outlook calendar, click the <span class="bold">Add this reservation to my calendar</span> checkbox at the bottom of the window.</p>
