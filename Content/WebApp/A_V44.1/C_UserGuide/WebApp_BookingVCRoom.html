            <MadCap:concept term="V44.1" />Book a Video Conference Room</h1>
        <p>Typically, video conference bookings involve at least two Rooms: the "host" Room where the meeting host user is located and at least one more additional Room where other attendees gather to participate. If you begin a Reservation or Booking using a video conferencing process template, you will be prompted during the booking process to confirm which one of your Rooms is the Host. The first Room you select will be automatically selected as the Host, but you can change the Host to a different Room once that additional Room is selected. You can select only one Room per Building. You can also specify a different headcount for each Room.</p>
        <p class="note-box tip">Tip: You may need to add multiple meeting Rooms, including the Host, to the Reservation. If all participants including the host gather in the same Room, however, you will only need one Room. Simply designate this sole Room as the Host.</p>
