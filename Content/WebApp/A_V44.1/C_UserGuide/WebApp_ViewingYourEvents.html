In addition, EMS will return search results that contain your search string regardless of where those characters appear. For example, a search string of ed returns the College of Education Seminar, Ed Smith fundraiser, Health Center Education Training, and so on.</p></div><div class="note-box note"><p>Note: The <span class="bold">BROWSE &gt; EVENTS</span> menu option shows all of your reservations as well as all reservations that you are authorized to view. The <span class="bold">MY EVENTS</span> menu option shows only your reservations and bookings. Before making your own reservations, especially if you are a newer EMS Web App user, we recommend that you <span class="bold">BROWSE &gt; EVENTS</span> first to build familiarity with your organization's booking practices, schedule, facilities, and users.
