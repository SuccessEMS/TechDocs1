            <MadCap:concept term="V44.1" />Skype for Business in the EMS Web App</h1>
        <p>Everyday Users can now integrate audio/video conferencing tools with EMS applications, starting with Skype for Business. It will no longer be necessary for users to simultaneously create a separate meeting to enable an audio/video conferencing component to their meetings. The EMS integration of Skype for Business allows users to easily integrate instant messaging and audio/video conferencing to their meetings without the need for A/V support.&#160;</p>
        <div class="note-box important">
            <p>Important: When considering using the Skype for Business Integration, keep in mind the following:&#160;</p>
            <ul class="unorder-list">
                <li>Skype for Business is <span class="bold">ONLY</span> available on <span class="bold">Exchange-enabled templates</span>. </li>
