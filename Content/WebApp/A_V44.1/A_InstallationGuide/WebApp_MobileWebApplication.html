            <MadCap:concept term="V44.1" />EMS Mobile Web Application</h1>
        <p>The EMS Web App also runs on a mobile device such as a tablet or handheld. Due to the smaller screen size and resolution of tablets and smartphones, pages may display differently but most of the same functionality is still available.</p>
        <p>EMS Mobile App, by contrast, is an app designed specifically for smartphones. It offers functionality specifically for everyday users who need access to EMS while they're on the go. The EMS Mobile App also runs on tablets that run iOS or Android, but the screen layout is optimized for smartphones and does not take advantage of larger displays.</p>
