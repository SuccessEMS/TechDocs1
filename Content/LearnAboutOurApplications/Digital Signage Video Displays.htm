        <h1>Digital Signage: Video Displays, Tablets, and Room Signs</h1>
        <h2>Digital Signage: Video Displays, Tablets, and Room Signs</h2>
        <p>Placed outside the entrance to meeting rooms, wall-mounted digital signs with EMS software allow employees to book themselves into reservable spaces.&#160;EMS provides the following, optional licenses to integrate with digital tablets and room signs.</p>
        <h3>EMS Kiosk</h3>
        <p>Run on a touch-screen display unit, EMS Kiosk is a powerful yet easy-to-use digital room sign and interactive tool for reviewing room availability, booking space, searching for a meeting location and more. Mount the unit outside a room and/or make an EMS Kiosk available in a lobby or entryway. Pair with the optional EMS Floor Plan module and give users an added measure of convenience as they see reserved/available space on a facility diagram, making it even easier to find &#160;and hold meeting space.&#160;<br />See Also:&#160;<a href="../InstallGuides/6_Kiosk/A_KioskHome.htm">EMS Kiosk Installation Overview</a>.</p>
        <h3>EMS Room Sign</h3>
        <p>This web-based application&#160;turns your Apple iPad or Android tablet into a digital room sign, displaying real-time meeting information and at-a-glance room availability. It supports Apple, Android, and Microsoft tablets, and integrates with popular room sign products, such as Creston Connected Scheduling Application and Steelcase RoomWizard, a separate EMS module.&#160;See Also:&#160;<a href="../InstallGuides/8_RoomSignAppV44.1/8_RoomSignAppHome.htm">EMS Room Sign Installation Overview</a>.</p>
        <h3>Video Displays</h3>
        <p>The EMS Video Display Interface&#160;(VDI) is an&#160;add-on component that exports meeting and event information to a video display system such as Janus, Target Vision, and so on.&#160;<br />See Also:&#160;<a href="../EMSDesktopClient/V44.1/ConfigurationGuide/VideoDisplayInterf.htm">VDI&#160;Installation Overview</a>.</p>
