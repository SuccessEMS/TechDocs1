        <h1 class="Heading1">VDI</h1>
        <p class="NormalWeb_2">The EMS&#160;Video Display Interface&#160;(VDI) is an optional, add-on component for EMS that exports meeting and event information to a video display system such as Janus, Target Vision, and so on. It does this by periodically saving booking information to a file which the video display system then retrieves and displays on video monitors. You use the windows-based Task Scheduler to set the frequency at which the EMS Video Display Interface program (EMS.exe) runs. This program stores the booking information and creates the export file. You set parameters in EMS that define the types of bookings that are to be included in the export file (based on buildings, statuses, and so on), where the exported file should reside, and other information. You must manually export the booking information once and create the export file before you can configure&#160;EMS to automatically export the information.</p>
