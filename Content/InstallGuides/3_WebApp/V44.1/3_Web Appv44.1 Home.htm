        <h1>EMS Web App </h1>
        <p>The EMS Web App is a browser-based interface to EMS that helps you to find and book an available workspace as well as schedule and manage meetings, events, services, and more.</p>
        <p>With the Web App (formerly known as Virtual EMS or VEMS), you can empower your employees to self-serve for specific meeting or work spaces or give them the ability to request reservations for managed spaces.</p>

                <MadCap:dropDownHotspot>Concept: The EMS Web App also runs on a mobile device such as a tablet or handheld</MadCap:dropDownHotspot>

                <p>Due to the smaller screen size and resolution of tablets and smartphones, pages may display differently but most of the same functionality is still available.</p>

        </MadCap:dropDown>
        <p>EMS Mobile App, by contrast, is an app designed specifically for smartphones. It offers functionality specifically for everyday users who need access to EMS while they're on the go. The EMS Mobile App also runs on tablets that run iOS or Android, but the screen layout is optimized for smartphones and does not take advantage of larger displays.</p>
