        <h1>EMS Exchange Room Integration (ERI) </h1>
        <p>Exchange Room Integration (ERI) is an add-on module that provides the ability to configure EMS rooms and resources to invite Microsoft<sup>®</sup> Exchange resource mailboxes, simplifying integrations with third-party technology, such as video conference systems. Bookings made by everyday users in EMS will handle the addition of the technologies, without the need for a separate process.</p>
