            <MadCap:concept term="V44.1" />Use Skype for Business in EMS for Outlook</h1>
        <p>Everyday Users can now integrate audio/video conferencing tools with EMS applications, starting with Skype for Business. It will no longer be necessary for users to simultaneously create a separate meeting to enable an audio/video conferencing component to their meetings. The EMS integration of Skype for Business allows users to easily integrate instant messaging and audio/video conferencing to their meetings without the need for A/V support. Skype for Business is&#160;<span class="bold">only&#160;</span>available for&#160;<span class="bold">Exchange-enabled templates</span>.&#160;For more information, see <a href="../../Skype/C_UserGuide/SkypeforBusiness_UserGuide_ConfigureSkypeforBusiness.html">Configure Skype for Business</a>.&#160;</p>
        <div class="note-box note">
            <p><span class="bold">Note:</span>&#160;Skype for Business meetings cannot be removed from Outlook appointments, including those tied to reservations using EMS for Outlook.</p>
