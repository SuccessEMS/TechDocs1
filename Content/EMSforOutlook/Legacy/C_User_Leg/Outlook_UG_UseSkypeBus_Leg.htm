            <MadCap:concept term="V44.1" />Use Skype for Business in EMS for Outlook (Legacy)</h1>
        <p>Everyday Users can now integrate audio/video conferencing tools with EMS applications, starting with Skype for Business. It will no longer be necessary for users to simultaneously create a separate meeting to enable an audio/video conferencing component to their meetings. The EMS integration of Skype for Business allows users to easily integrate instant messaging and audio/video conferencing to their meetings without the need for A/V support. Skype for Business is&#160;<span class="bold">only&#160;</span>available for&#160;<span class="bold">Exchange-enabled templates</span>.&#160;For more information about Configuring Skype for Business, click&#160;<MadCap:xref href="../../../Skype/C_UserGuide/SkypeforBusiness_UserGuide_ConfigureSkypeforBusiness.html">here</MadCap:xref>.&#160;</p>
        <p>Note:&#160;Skype for Business meetings cannot be removed from Outlook appointments, including those tied to reservations using EMS for Outlook.</p>
        <h2>To Use Skype for Business:</h2>
        <ol start="1">
            <li>Ensure you have the Skype for Outlook add-in.</li>
            <li>Open Microsoft Outlook and create a standard event request that includes the event subject, the date, and time for the event, and invite the necessary attendees.</li>
            <li>Click the <span class="bold">EMS Room Manager </span>icon.&#160;<MadCap:xref href="Outlook_UG_CreateResOverview_Leg.htm">Create your reservation</MadCap:xref>.&#160;</li>
            <li>Under the&#160;<span class="bold">Meeting&#160;</span>tab, click the&#160;<span class="bold">Skype Meeting</span>&#160;button on the top menu.&#160;Skype meeting information will appear in your meeting invitation and will be stored on the EMS database.<p><img src="../../../Resources/Images/Using EMS for Outlook/Using Skype for Business in.png" alt="SkypeforBusiness.PNG" /></p></li>
            <li>If this is your first time using Skype for Business, an authentication form will appear. Sign in using your Skype credentials.
            <ul><li>If the user's Skype account is authenticated, they can continue creating their reservation.&#160;</li><li>If the user's Skype account is not authenticated, an authentication modal will appear.</li><li>If the user fails to authenticate their Skype account, the Skype toggle will be disabled.&#160;</li></ul></li>
        </ol>
        <p>Note:&#160;Authentication&#160;to Skype is dependent upon the deployment type.</p>
        <p><span class="bold">There are three deployment&#160;types for Skype for Business:</span>
        </p>
        <ol start="1">
            <li><span class="bold">On Premise: </span>This deployment for Skype for Business does not retain a token and requires authentication every 8 hours. As a result, you will be asked to sign in every 8 hours.&#160;</li>
            <li><span class="bold">Online:</span> This deployment retains the token so only an initial authentication is required.&#160;</li>
            <li><span class="bold">Hybrid:</span> This deployment has the same authentication method as the Online deployment.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>For more information regarding authentications in Skype for Business, see <MadCap:xref href="../../../Skype/C_UserGuide/SkypeforBusiness_UserGuide_ConfigureSkypeforBusiness.html">Configure Skype for Business</MadCap:xref>.</p>
        <ol start="6">
            <li>Complete your reservation. Once Skype has been added to your meeting, the Skype meeting information will appear in all EMS applications that have been integrated with Skype for Business (i.e., EMS Mobile App and EMS Web App).</li>
        </ol>
