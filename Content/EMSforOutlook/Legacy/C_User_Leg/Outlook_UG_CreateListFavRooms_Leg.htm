            <MadCap:concept term="V44.1" />Create a List of Favorite Rooms</h1>
        <p>Users can create a list of favorite rooms that can be searched for availability when creating a room request. This list of favorites is created in the&#160;My Account&#160;section of the&#160;EMS Web App. Once created in the Web App, the&#160;list of favorites will be displayed in the Facilities dropdown list on the Room Request page in EMS for Microsoft Outlook and the EMS Web App.&#160;If you leave the Facilities field set to this value, then all the rooms that are contained in this Favorites list are automatically searched for availability after you click Find Space.</p>
