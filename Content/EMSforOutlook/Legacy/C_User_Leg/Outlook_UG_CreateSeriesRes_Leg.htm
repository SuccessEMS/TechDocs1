        <p>A Series Reservation is a single reservation that includes multiple bookings. EMS for Outlook allows you to search for rooms that are available at a particular time on multiple days to create a series reservation. This section details the creation of a series reservation for a non-video conference meeting. For information about scheduling a video conference meeting, see&#160;<MadCap:xref href="Outlook_UG_CreateVideoConfRes_Leg.htm">Create a Video Conference Reservation</MadCap:xref>.&#160;</p>
        <p>From this section, you will be able to:</p>

        </p>
        <p>Tip:&#160;The Start Time and End Time are designated when you set up the meeting in Outlook. You can edit these values in EMS for Outlook&#160;via the date and time fields or later after booking.&#160;</p>
        <ol start="3">
            <li>In the Appointment Recurrence dialog box, specify the Appointment Time, Recurrence pattern, Range of recurrence, and End by Date.&#160;Click&#160;<span class="bold">OK</span>.&#160;</li>
        </ol>
        <p>Warning:&#160;Ensure you set an End Date for the recurrence. EMS for Outlook does not support infinite recurring meetings.&#160;</p>
        <ol start="4">
            <li>Click the&#160;<span class="bold">EMS Room Manager</span>&#160;icon in the top menu bar of Outlook.</li>
            <li>Select a Template from the dropdown list (the list contains pre-defined templates set by your System Administrator).&#160;</li>
            <li>Select a Room. By default, for a recurring meeting, EMS for Outlook opens in the List view. The List view shows the availability for all rooms. The list will include a&#160;<span class="bold">Days Available</span> column. This feature allows you to view how many days the space is available during your recurrence date range (e.g., 10/10 days). Click the&#160;<span class="bold">Select </span>(<span class="bold">+</span>)&#160;button on the left to select your room. If your room is available for all of your days, continue creating your reservation.</li>
            <li>If the room you selected is not available for all days (e.g., only 8/10 days), the&#160;<span class="bold">Resolve Conflicts</span>&#160;dialog box will appear. (For example, for a recurrent meeting with 10 meeting dates, Demo Room 06&#160;is available for 8 out of the 10 meeting dates.)</li>
            <li>Choose a location that is available for the remaining dates during your recurrence and click the green&#160;<span class="bold">Select </span>(<span class="bold">+</span>)&#160;button.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>Note:&#160;If the user does not wish to choose a room that resolves the conflict, they can skip the resolve conflicts process. Dates that are skipped will not be assigned a room and the location field in the meeting in Outlook will not be populated. The user can review the reservation at a later date and choose rooms for the skipped dates.</p>
        <ol start="9">
            <li>Optionally, click on the&#160;<span class="bold">Selected Locations</span>&#160;tab to view information about the selected room(s), such as Days Available, Location, Floor, Building, Location Type, Capacity, and Attendee Count.
