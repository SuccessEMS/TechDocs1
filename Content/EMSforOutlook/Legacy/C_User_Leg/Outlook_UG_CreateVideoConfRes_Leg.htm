            <MadCap:concept term="V44.1" />Create a Video Conference Reservation</h1>
        <p>You can create a video conference reservation for both a single reservation and a series reservation. When you create a video conference reservation, two room options are available:</p>
        <ol start="1">
            <li>The room is a dedicated video conferencing room. (The room has built-in video conferencing features.)</li>
            <li>The room has no built-in video conferencing features. Instead, you must use a mobile video conferencing cart in the room.</li>
        </ol>
        <h2>To create a video conference reservation:&#160;</h2>
        <ol start="1">
            <li>Follow the appropriate steps for creating either a&#160;<MadCap:xref href="Outlook_UG_CreateSingleRes_Leg.htm">single</MadCap:xref>&#160;or&#160;<MadCap:xref href="Outlook_UG_CreateSeriesRes_Leg.htm">series</MadCap:xref>&#160;reservation.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>Tip:&#160;Please note the&#160;following differences for a video conference reservation:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>A video conference reservation requires two rooms</li>
            <li>You&#160;<span class="bold">must&#160;</span>always designate the capacity for each room</li>
            <li>You&#160;<span class="bold">must&#160;</span>indicate which room is the&#160;<span class="italics">host&#160;</span>room</li>
        </ul>
        <ol start="2">
            <li>Add the video conference option to your reservation. The Video Conference Room dialog box will appear.</li>

        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>If a room that you request for a video conference reservation requires a mobile video conferencing cart, and at least one mobile video conferencing cart is available, then an orange line is displayed for the room. After you book the room, the standard booking color of yellow with an orange line above it is displayed to indicate that you have successfully booked the room and a cart for the room.</li>
            <li>If a room that you request for a video conference reservation requires a mobile video conferencing cart, but no carts (resources) are available to book, then a solid orange rectangle is displayed for the room to indicate that the maximum number of resources are in use and you cannot book the room.</li>
            <li>If a room that you request for a video conference reservation has built-in video conferencing features and the room is available to book, then no color is initially displayed for the room. After you book the room, the standard booking color of yellow is displayed to indicate that you have successfully booked the room.</li>
        </ul>
        <ol start="3">
            <li>After you successfully book a video conference reservation, the host room is indicated on the <span class="bold">Selected </span>tab.</li>
