        <p class="Body">A recurrent meeting calls for rooms that are available for a particular time on multiple days. </p>
        <ol>
            <li>To begin, open Microsoft Outlook and set up a standard <em xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">recurring </em>meeting (using the <strong xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Recurrence</strong> button  from the Outlook toolbar); in Outlook, specify: </li>
        </ol>
        <ul>
            <li>subject</li>
            <li>dates and times</li>
            <li>attendees</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="note-box"><strong xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Tip:  </strong>Be sure to set an end date for the recurrence. EMS&#160;for Outlook does not support infinite recurring meetings.</p>
        <ol start="2">
            <li>Click the EMS&#160;for Outlook icon in the Outlook toolbar. The EMS for Outlook add-in opens in the List view. The List view shows the availability for up to 750 rooms. The Start Time and the End Time are pulled from the initial meeting your started in Outlook. You cannot edit these values.</li>
        </ol>
        <ol start="2" MadCap:continue="true">
            <li>On the <strong xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Select Template</strong> field, select a <a title="Glossary" href.path="//001_Using_EMS_V44.1/Glossary" href.anchor="booking%2Btemplate" href.filename="" href="../../../Glossary/1_Glossary.htm" alt="Glossary" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">booking template</a> for the type of reservation you are making.

            <li>On the<strong xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"> Event Type</strong> field, select the event type.</li>
            <li>Use the <strong xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Groups </strong>field to specify the person who is hosting the reservation.

        <p class="note-box"><strong xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Tip: </strong>You can view and manipulate the List view and narrow your room search results. This view is the best way for you to choose from<em xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"> only rooms that are available</em> for this booking (this prevents you from accidentally choosing rooms that might cause a conflict). You can also <a title="Viewing The Schedule" href.path="//001_Using_EMS_V44.1/Using_EMS_for_Outlook_(V44.1)/Getting_Started_With_EMS_for_Outlook/020_Viewing_The_Schedule" href.filename="" href="Outlook_UG_ViewSchedule.html" alt="Viewing The Schedule" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">switch to the Schedule tab</a> at any time to see your booking progress, attendees' availability, and other bookings on the calendar.</p>
        <p class="note-box" xmlns=""><strong xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Tip: You can add multiple rooms for a single booking.</strong> Additionally, if you select a room that does not have all the days available that you requested (the Days Available is less than your total days), a <strong xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Resolve Conflicts </strong>popup will appear where you can select a different room for the unresolved days.</p>
        <ol start="6">
            <li>Select the room(s). The <strong xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Selected Rooms </strong>tab shows the number of rooms selected for the meeting. </li>

            <li>Click Save and Send. The selected room is booked and automatically added to your Outlook calendar, even if the selected room was not available for all the dates. Regardless of the meeting room availability, all the invited meeting attendees receive a standard Outlook invitation. The invitees accept or decline the meeting invitation as they normally would in Outlook. The next time you open the EMS for Outlook add-in and show the date of the scheduled event, the room status is indicated as "Booked" for the event dates for which the room is available, and "Booking in Conflict" for the event dates for which the room is unavailable. </li>
