        <h1 class="mt-export-title">Viewing The Schedule</h1>
        <p>Once you begin booking a meeting in Microsoft Outlook, click the EMS for Outlook icon to see the schedule grid. This provides a calendar grid showing all bookings you are authorized to see. </p>
        <p>Events on the grid are color-coded: <br /></p>
        <p class="NoteTipWarningText">Setup and teardown times show as narrower bars bracketing the event. This is defined by your Administrator.<br /></p>
        <p class="NoteTipWarningText">The view automatically shows attendees' free/busy schedules for the meeting date (attendees are listed in the left panel, and their schedule appears to the right in the grid). To hide availability schedules for attendees, de-select the <strong>Include Attendees In Schedule </strong>box in the lower right corner. </p>
        <h3>Filtering the View</h3>
        <p class="NoteTipWarningText">You can quickly filter the schedule to only show events for a location, such as a building. </p>
        <p class="note-box"><strong xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Tip:  </strong>You can resize the left and right panels by clicking and dragging the borders between them, and your settings will be saved. Double-clicking the resize handle will reset the grid size to the default setting. </p>
        <h3>Viewing Room Information</h3>
        <p class="NoteTipWarningText">Click the <strong>Information </strong>icon next to a room to see more information about the room, such as its properties, geographic location, setup type, features, images (if available), and so on. </p>

                <p>Your Administrator controls how these are labeled in the grid; the example above shows meetings labeled by the person hosting the meeting (from the <strong xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Group</strong> field).</p>
