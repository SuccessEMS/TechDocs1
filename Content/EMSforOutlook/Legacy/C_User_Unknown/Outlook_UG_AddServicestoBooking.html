        <h1 class="mt-export-title">Adding Services to a Booking</h1>
        <p>You can add services to a booking provided that the room, booking template, and event type allow it to be added. You will only see allowable services when adding them to an event. </p>
        <ol>
            <li xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">To add services to a meeting, click the <strong>Services tab</strong> from the Meeting<strong>. </strong>If the tab is not available, your Administrator has not designated services for the booking template you are using.</li>
        </ol>
        <ol start="2" style="list-style-type: decimal;">
            <li>For <em>recurrent</em> meetings, multiple bookings are listed in the left panel; select the booking for you wish to add special services. (Otherwise, the Services tab lists your one-time booking and it is already selected). The center panel shows services available for the selected room booking.</li>
        </ol>
        <p class="NoteTipWarningText" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Depending on your administrator's settings, a room may offer the following types of services (in the central panel):</p>
        <ul xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">
            <li class="NoteTipWarningText">Catering</li>
            <li class="NoteTipWarningText">Resources with or without Service Orders</li>
            <li class="NoteTipWarningText">Notes</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="NoteTipWarningText" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Unlike other EMS applications, you cannot specify services that are Activities or Attendees.</p>
        <ol start="3" style="list-style-type: decimal;">
            <li>Click the Category of service in the center panel you wish to work with.  The right panel refreshes to show (expandable) options available in that category.</li>
        </ol>
        <ol start="4" style="list-style-type: decimal;">
            <li>Make your selections and click the <strong xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Apply </strong>or <strong xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Apply to Multiple</strong> button. 		If you select <strong xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Apply to Multiple </strong>(typically for recurrent meetings), the Apply to Additional Bookings popup presents, where you can select which room bookings should have the service included.<br xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" /><![CDATA[	]]></li>
