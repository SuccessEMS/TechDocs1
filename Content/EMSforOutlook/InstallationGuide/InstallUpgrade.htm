        <h2>EMS for Microsoft Outlook Web Deployment Option</h2>
        <p>As of the Update 19.1 software release (December 2017), a web deployment option is now available for EMS for Microsoft Outlook. This is the recommended method for installing EMS for Outlook locally on individual user machines. Administrators can use the web deployment to host EMS for Outlook on a web server, with the ability to push the URL to any EMS Administrators so they can download EMS for Outlook without needing Administrative Privileges on their local machine.</p>
        <p>For either 32- or 64-bit installation, you will also need an EMS Platform Services Virtual Directory Name (typical default is EMSPlatform). Make a note of the new site you have created. This URL will need to be entered during the installation process (e.g.,<span class="bold"> http://[ServerName]/EMSPlatform/</span> [replace ServerName with the name of your web server]).</p>
        <h3>Benefits of Web Deployment Option</h3>
        <p>The web deploy application is installed on your web server. The EMS for Outlook Add-in is included within this installation. Once installed, end users point their web browsers to the EMS Web Deployment Application, which points them with a link to download the EMS for Outlook Add-in. Once a user downloads and runs that link, the EMS for Outlook is installed in the user's profile on that workstation. Once installed, the EMS for Outlook Add-in will check the server for an updated version of the client each time the client is launched. If a new version is available, then it will automatically download and install the update.</p>
