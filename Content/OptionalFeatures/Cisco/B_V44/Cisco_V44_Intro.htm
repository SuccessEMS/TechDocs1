            <MadCap:concept term="V44" />Introduction to Cisco TMS</h1>
        <p>EMS clients use EMS for their facility scheduling needs along with Cisco TelePresence Management Suite (TMS) to manage their video communication systems, most typically to enable EMS bookings to connect with Cisco TMS equipment management&#160;software so users can manage the equipment directly through EMS. Cisco TMS provides a 3rd&#160;Party Booking API that exposes Cisco TMS booking functionality to external scheduling systems like EMS. This document lists the steps you must take to install and configure the EMS interface to Cisco TMS.&#160;</p>
