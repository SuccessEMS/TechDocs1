        <p>If your organization uses a Facilities Management (FM) System, facility information may already be maintained there. The EMS FM Toolkit eliminates the need for double entry of facility details and maintenance. Information is automatically updated in EMS to provide the highest level of accuracy and improved communication across departments.&#160;This toolkit&#160;synchronizes the inventory of space between your facility management systems and EMS to ensure cross-system accuracy.&#160;Both EMS and facilities management systems are built upon an inventory of buildings and rooms that forms the basis for meeting and event reservations. The FM Toolkit serves as the connection point between these two systems. The toolkit transfers chosen records to a staging database and updates the appropriate tables in EMS.&#160;As with the HR Toolkit, this automates&#160;the creation, maintenance, and inactivation of select Building and Room properties from an outside data source.</p>
