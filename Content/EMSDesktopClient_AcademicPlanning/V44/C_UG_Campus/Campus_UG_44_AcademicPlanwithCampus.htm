        <p>Academic Planning is an optional component of the EMS software that provides all the functionality that is necessary for Domain Schedulers to ensure that every class meets in a location and at a time that is acceptable to departments and professors. The system provides automatic room assignment within user-supplied parameters, integration with your SIS/ERP software, and efficient online collaboration tools. It also simplifies final exam scheduling and offers a selection of reports to streamline and analyze the room scheduling process. When added to the functionality that meeting and event staff already have access to, it provides a complete campus-wide space management package referred to as EMS Campus.</p>
