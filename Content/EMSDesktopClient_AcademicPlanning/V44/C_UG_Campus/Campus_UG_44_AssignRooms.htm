            <MadCap:concept term="V44" />Assign Rooms</h1>
        <p>After you have completed pre-assignment of rooms and/or room optimization, four options are available to resolve room assignments:</p>
        <ol>
            <li><span class="bold">Assign</span>—the Assign option lists all rooms regardless of availability or preferences. It is intended to provide a means for you to quickly assign a room without going through the search process.</li>
            <li><span class="bold">Search</span>—the Search option initially lists any preferences and requirements that were specified during the Set Preferences mode. You can use these preferences as a basis for a room search or you can specify and/or clear other criteria to complete the room search.</li>
            <li><span class="bold">Unassign</span>—the Unassign option removes the Assigned status for a course. You can then use the Assign option or the Search option to assign a different room to the course. The Unassign option is available after you assign a room to a course, or search for a room, and then assign it to a course.</li>
            <li><span class="bold">Swap</span>—the Swap option allows you to swap the room assignments of two courses. The swap option is only available after selecting two courses that have identical meeting patterns&#160;and that have been assigned to rooms.</li>
        </ol>

            <li class="ListParagraph">On the Building dropdown list, select (all) buildings or select a specific building that contains the rooms that you are considering for assignment.&#160;The rooms are displayed in the dialog box. By default, only those rooms that can meet the enrollment expectations, regardless of availability are displayed. Rooms that are excluded from the scenario are marked with an asterisk (*), but you can override these rooms.</li>
            <li class="ListParagraph">Optionally, to display all rooms in the Room Selector dialog box, clear the Limit to Est. Enrollment option.</li>
            <li class="ListParagraph">Select a room, and then click OK.&#160;If the room could not be assigned to one or more courses because of a conflict, then a message opens indicating this. Click OK to close the message, and repeat this step until you successfully assign a room to the courses.</li>
            <li class="ListParagraph">Repeat&#160;Step 2&#160;through&#160;Step 5&#160;until you have successfully assigned rooms to all courses for the term. After you have assigned a room to a course, at any time, you can do any of the following:</li>
        </ol>
        <ul class="ul_2">
            <li class="ListParagraph">To change a room assignment for a course, select a course for which a room has been assigned, and then click Unassign. You can then repeat&#160;Step 2&#160;through&#160;Step 5&#160;to assign a room to the course.</li>
            <li class="ListParagraph">Courses that were pre-assigned are listed as Locked In. To re-optimize any portion of the course assignments, select one or more assigned courses (CTRL-click to select multiple courses), and then click Lock In to lock in these additional courses, and then rerun your optimization scenario.</li>
            <li class="ListParagraph">To swap the room assignments of two courses, CTRL-click to select two courses with identical meeting patterns, and then click Swap.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Tip:&#160;You can open the Resolve Room Assignments window at any time by clicking Resolve on the Scenarios window. The system does not require all courses to be assigned to rooms. Those courses that are left unassigned are placed in a special TBD room when publishing and can be assigned post-publish.</p>
