            <MadCap:concept term="V44" />Edit or Cancel Courses</h1>
        <p>When you are defining and editing courses, you have the option of selecting Define and Edit mode, or Dual mode. Dual mode enables a term for both Define &amp; Edit Mode and Set Preference mode at the same time. If you select Define and Edit mode, then the steps that you carry out during this mode are distinct and unique from the steps that you carry out in the next mode, which is the Set Preferences mode. Although these two modes are presented as distinct modes and discussed in two separate sections in this manual, if you select Dual mode, then the steps listed in both these sections are applicable at the same time.</p>
        <p>After a term has been made available to the academic units, the academic units can begin&#160;<span class="link">reviewing</span>&#160;their courses and requesting additions, deletions, and modifications as appropriate using the EMS Campus Planning Interface (typical) or the EMS Campus desktop client (if granted access).</p>

        <p>Tips:&#160;Depending on how your EMS administrator has configured EMS Campus, only the Time Blocks option might be available to you. (You cannot manually edit the course days and times.)</p>
        <p>The Seat Fill Percentage is initially set to the default value that is specified in EMS (Campus) system parameters, but you can update the value on a per course date basis. See System Parameters in the EMS Setup Guide.</p>

            <li class="ListParagraph">The Seat Fill Percentage, in conjunction with the estimated enrollment, is used to determine the size of the room needed for the class. For example, a Seat Fill Percentage of 50% and an estimated enrollment of 100 means that the course should be held in a room that can accommodate 200 people.</li>
            <li class="ListParagraph">If you are editing a course date for a course that is cross-listed or sharing space with another course, you are provided with an option in the bottom pane of the Course Dates dialog box to apply your changes to the related course dates. To apply changes to the cross-listed courses, check the appropriate course date listings.</li>
