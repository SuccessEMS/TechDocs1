        <p>1. On the EMS Academic Planning menu bar, click <span class="bold">Academic Planning </span>&gt; <span class="bold">Courses </span>&gt; <span class="bold">Manage Terms</span>.&#160;The Terms window opens.</p>

This window lists all the courses that were not updated in the SIS along with an accompanying reason. If the reason is an error, you must resolve the error before you can continue with the manual publishing.
