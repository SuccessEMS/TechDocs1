            <MadCap:concept term="V44" />Enable/Disable a Term for Set Preferences Mode</h1>
        <p>To enter the academic units’ room preferences and requirements, you must enable&#160;Set Preferences mode. Additionally, if you want to solicit these preferences and requirements from the academic units, you must make&#160;the term available to the academic units. Likewise, after the deadline has been reached for expressing room preferences and requirements, you must make&#160;the term unavailable to the academic units.</p>
