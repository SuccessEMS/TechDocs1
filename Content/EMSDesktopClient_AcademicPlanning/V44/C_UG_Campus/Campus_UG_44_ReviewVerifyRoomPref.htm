            <MadCap:concept term="V44" />Review and Verify Room Preferences</h1>
        <p>After room preferences and requirements are set, you can review&#160;the individual course preferences, verify that the preferences are complete, and quantify these preferences. You can also run the Course Preferences report and the Course Preferences Summary report to assist in this task.</p>
        <p>Tips:&#160;For detailed information about generating the Course Preferences and Course Preferences Summary reports and the information that is contained in each report, see&#160;<MadCap:xref href="Campus_UG_44_GenerateAcadReports.htm">Generating Academic Reports</MadCap:xref></p>
        <p>Prior to reviewing or reporting on preferences, you can make the term unavailable to the academic units. See&#160;<a href="Campus_UG_44_EnableDisableTermSetPrefMode.htm">Enabling and Disabling a Term for Set Preferences Mode</a>.</p>
