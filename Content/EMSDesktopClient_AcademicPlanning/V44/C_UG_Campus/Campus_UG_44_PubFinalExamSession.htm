            <MadCap:concept term="V44" />Publish a Final Exam Session</h1>
        <p>After you have created the final exam schedule template for the term, and updated any final exam settings, you must publish the final exam session. Publishing a final exam session is a two part process. First, you must&#160;create&#160;a final exam session and specify a start date for the session. Second, you must then apply a final exam schedule template to the final exam session and then you can&#160;publish&#160;the session.&#160;</p>

After you publish a final exam session, you can find the final exam booking for a course by opening the course in the Navigator and expanding the reservation and scrolling to the bottom of the Reservation (left) pane, or to the bottom of the Bookings (lower right) pane. You can use the Final Exam Schedule report to review the final exam schedule or the Final Exam Settings report to view optional settings.
