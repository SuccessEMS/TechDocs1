            <MadCap:concept term="V44" />Unpublish a Previously Published Academic Term</h1>
        <p>For a variety of reasons, you might need to&#160;unpublish&#160;a previously published term, for example, you accidentally published the term using the wrong scenario, or you forgot to mark excluded dates before you published the term.</p>
        <p>Warning: Even though you might have a valid reason for unpublishing a term, do not do so without great consideration. Unpublishing a term deletes all reservations and bookings that are associated with the term.</p>
