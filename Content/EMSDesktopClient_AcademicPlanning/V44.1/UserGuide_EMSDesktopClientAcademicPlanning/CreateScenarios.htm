        <p>Although the process for your organization might vary, a typical approach for using scenarios to optimize room assignments is to first&#160;create&#160;a pre-assignment scenario to partially complete the assignment of rooms to courses for a term. You would then copy this pre-assignment scenario and edit it as needed to make an optimization scenario, and then run this optimization scenario to continue with the assignment of rooms to courses. You can&#160;create&#160;as many optimization scenarios as needed, either by copying an existing scenario or creating one “from scratch.”</p>
