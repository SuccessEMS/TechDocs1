        <h1>
            <MadCap:concept term="V44.1" />Specify Room Preferences/Requirements</h1>
        <p><span class="bold">Set Preferences</span> is an optional mode in which the Domain Scheduler can solicit preferences from academic units about the type of rooms that would be suitable for each course that they teach. These preferences can then be used to run an optimization, or to have EMS automate room scheduling based on preferences and additional user-specified criteria. To enable and use Set Preferences Mode, the following steps are carried out:</p>
        <ol class="number-list">
            <li>The Domain Scheduler enables Set Preferences mode. See <a href="EnableDisableTermSetPrefMode.htm">Enable/Disable a Term for Set Preferences Mode</a>.</li>
            <li>The academic units review courses and specify their room preferences and requirements using the EMS Campus Planning Interface (typical) or the EMS Campus desktop client (if granted access). </li>
            <li>The Domain Scheduler verifies and reviews the room preferences and requirements that the academic units have specified. See <MadCap:xref href="ReviewVerifyRoomPref.htm">Review and Verify Room Preferences</MadCap:xref>.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>After you place the term in Set Preferences mode, three options that can be used in conjunction with each other are available for completing the preferences and requirements phase. In addition, you can complete the phase independently, or you can solicit input from the academic units.</p>
        <p>This topic will provide information that will allow you to:</p>
        <ul class="unorder-list">
            <li>
                <MadCap:xref href="#UseManageTerms">Use the Manage Terms Copy Preferences Tool</MadCap:xref>—You can&#160;use the Manage Terms Copy Preferences tool to copy the preferences and requirements from a previous term.</li>
            <li>
                <MadCap:xref href="#UseAcademicBrowser">Use the Academic Browser Set Course Preferences Tool</MadCap:xref>—You can use the Academic Browser Set Course Preferences tool to set preferences and requirements for multiple courses in a single step. </li>

        </ul>
        <p class="box-tip"><span class="bold">TIP:</span>&#160;If a course must take place in a specific room that you plan to exclude from optimization, you can pre-assign it to a specific room. This process is outlined during the Scenario phase. See&#160;<a href="CreateScenarios.htm">Create Scenarios</a>.</p>
        <p>For any of these methods, the following caveats apply:</p>
        <ul class="unorder-list">
            <li>An academic unit-level user can&#160;request&#160;any building, area, or view and up to three rooms that have been defined for the domain with which it is associated.</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="box-tip"><span class="bold">TIP:</span>&#160;If needed, you can set the Lock Academic Unit Room Access system parameter to limit the users to their specific academic units. See <a href="../../../EMSDesktopClient/V44.1/ConfigurationGuide/SystemParam.htm">System Parameters</a> in the EMS Desktop Client Configuration Guide.</p>
        <ul class="unorder-list">
            <li>An academic unit can&#160;require&#160;only those buildings and rooms that have been assigned to its unit within the Academic Planning &gt; Configuration &gt; Academic Units area of EMS Academic Planning. If the academic units specify requirements, then only a single room can be specified.</li>
            <li>Room types can be requested or required for all courses. By default the “limit by course type” selection is designated, but you can change it to honor a specific room type.</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="box-tip"><span class="bold">TIP:</span>&#160;Configuration of the Course Types/RoomTypes matches is carried out in the Academic Planning &gt; Configuration &gt; Match Course Types/Room Types area of EMS Academic Planning. See the <a href="../../../ConfigGuides/2_EMS_Desktop_Client_CG.htm">EMS Desktop Client Configuration Guide</a> for detailed information.</p>
        <ul class="unorder-list">
            <li>You can set features to <span class="bold">Preferred </span>or <span class="bold">Required</span>. The # of Rooms Available label that is displayed above the Features pane is dynamically updated based on the building, room type, and features selected.</li>
            <li>The Seat Fill Percentage, in conjunction with the estimated enrollment, is used to determine the size of the room needed for the class. For example, a Seat Fill Percentage of 50% and an estimated enrollment of 100 means that the course should be held in a room that can accommodate 200 people.</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="box-tip"><span class="bold">TIP:</span>&#160;The Seat Fill Percentage is initially set to the default value that is specified in EMS (Campus) system parameters, but you can update the value on a per course date basis. See the <a href="../../../ConfigGuides/2_EMS_Desktop_Client_CG.htm">EMS Desktop Client Configuration Guide</a>.</p>
        <ul class="unorder-list">
            <li>Ignore Term Excluded Dates schedules bookings on all dates that adhere to the meeting pattern, regardless of the Excluded Dates that are marked on the term when the course dates are published.</li>
            <li>Publish In SIS Room (No Optimization) allows the course dates to avoid the optimization process. Bookings are published in the room that was carried over from the SIS.</li>
            <li>Require SIS Room flags buildings/rooms that come across from the SIS as Required. Courses with requirements still go through the optimization process.</li>
            <li>Requires Different Room (For Courses That Share Space) identifies a meeting pattern that should be in its own room despite the cross-listed or shared space status. You can set preferences for this room.</li>
            <li>Same Room (ALL Selected Course Dates are to be in the same Room) flags courses that should be in the same room but at different times when optimized.</li>
