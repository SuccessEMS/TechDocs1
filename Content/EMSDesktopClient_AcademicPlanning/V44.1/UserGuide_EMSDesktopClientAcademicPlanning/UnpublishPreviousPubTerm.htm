            <MadCap:concept term="V44.1" />Unpublish a Previously Published Academic Term</h1>
        <p>For a variety of reasons, you might need to&#160;unpublish&#160;a previously published term, for example, you accidentally published the term using the wrong scenario, or you forgot to mark excluded dates before you published the term.</p>
        <p>Warning: Even though you might have a valid reason for unpublishing a term, do not do so without great consideration. Unpublishing a term deletes all reservations and bookings that are associated with the term.</p>

            <li class="ListParagraph">Select the term that you are unpublishing, and then click Unpublish.&#160;A message opens indicating that unpublishing will remove all reservations and bookings for the selected term, and asking you if it is OK to continue.</li>
            <li class="ListParagraph">Click <span class="bold">Yes</span>.&#160;The message closes. After the term is unpublished, a second message opens indicating that the term was successfully unpublished.</li>
            <li class="ListParagraph">Click <span class="bold">OK </span>to close the second message and return to the Terms window.</li>
