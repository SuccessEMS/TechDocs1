            <MadCap:concept term="V44.1" />Using the Course Navigator</h1>
        <p>The Course Navigator is a window in EMS Academic Planning that you use to view and manage all aspects of a course. You can&#160;access&#160;the Course Navigator from the Academic Browser, the Academic Book, and the EMS Navigator. Different&#160;tabs&#160;and&#160;panes&#160;on the Course Navigator provide different information about a course and course dates. The&#160;actions&#160;that you can carry out in the Course Navigator depend upon the mode (Read Only, Define and Edit Courses, Set Preferences, or Dual) that is enabled for the academic term with which you are working in EMS Academic Planning.</p>
        <p>You can access the Course Navigator from the Academic Browser, the Academic Book, and the EMS Navigator.</p>

        <p>The top pane of the Course Navigator displays information about a selected&#160;course—the course title, the course term, the current course state (New, Edit, Unchanged, or Canceled), and so on. The middle pane of the Course Navigator displays information about each of the&#160;course dates&#160;for the course. To view the indicated information for a course date, select a course date in the middle pane of the Course Navigator, and then open the appropriate tab (Dates, User Defined Fields, Shares Spaces, Preferences, or Final Exam Settings). The History tabs in the middle and lower pane provide audit information for course records and course date records.

To view changes made to&#160;course date-level&#160;information, select a course date in the middle pane, and then open the History tab in the&#160;bottom&#160;pane of the Course Navigator.</p>
