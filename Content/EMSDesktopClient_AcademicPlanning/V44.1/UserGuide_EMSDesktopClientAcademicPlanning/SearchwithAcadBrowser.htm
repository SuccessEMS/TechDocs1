            <MadCap:concept term="V44.1" />Searching with the Academic Browser</h1>
        <p>You can use the Academic Browser to&#160;search&#160;for courses or course dates. The results are displayed in a list view. When you carry out a search in the Academic Browser, you can carry out a basic search or an advanced search. A basic search is based on the basic information that you specify for a course when you first create it, such as the domain, the term, the academic unit, the subject, and so on. An advanced search is a field level search that is carried out at the course level, the course dates level, or the preference level or for published terms, at the reservation, booking or booking detail levels. For example, in an advanced search, you can specify criteria as granular as “courses with credit hours greater than 3.0.” After the search results are returned, you have a variety of options for working with the results, including sorting and grouping information or using the Tools menu to perform functions. The actions that you can carry out in the Academic Browser depend upon the mode (Read Only, Define and Edit Courses, or Set Preferences) that is enabled for the academic term with which you are working in EMS Campus.</p>
