        <p>A <span class="italics">time block template</span> is an aggregate of individual, unique meeting patterns for a course, for example, MWF from 2:00 to 2:50 pm, TR from 1:30 to 2:50 pm, and M from 1 to 3:50 pm. You can use time block templates to limit the meeting patterns that are available during Define &amp; Edit mode or Dual mode, to add weight to courses that comply with the template during optimization, and in academic reporting. You can manually configure&#160;time block templates, or if time block patterns from a previously configured term meet your needs, then you can import&#160;these time patterns and make a new template. During the configuration of time block patterns, or after importing time block patterns, if any of these patterns are the ones that are the most frequently requested and/or used for courses, then you can designate these patterns as <span class="italics">prime time</span>.</p>
