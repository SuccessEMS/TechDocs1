        <p>You use the Make a Reservation page in EMS Kiosk&#160;to make your own reservations for today.</p>
        <p>Tip:&#160;The following procedure is written from the perspective of a group search; however, depending on how your EMS Kiosk is configured, you might be required to enter a personnel number/employee ID number for your search criteria.</p>
        <ol start="1">
            <li>Click <span class="bold">Make a Reservation</span>.&#160;A page opens with options for searching for a group/person.</li>
        </ol>

        </p>
        <ol start="2">
            <li>In the Group field, enter your search criteria, and then click <span class="bold">Search</span>.&#160;A list of all groups/people that meet your search criteria is displayed.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>Tip: The search is limited to the exact order of the characters in the string but the string can be found anywhere in the search results and it is not case-sensitive. For example, a search string of “ed” returns both Anderson, Scott and Evans,&#160;Dean.</p>
