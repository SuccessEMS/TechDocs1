        <p>The Today’s Events page in EMS Kiosk&#160;lists&#160;<span class="italics">all&#160;</span>the events that are scheduled for today. Typically, the Today’s Events page is the default page (the page that opens first) when you start EMS.</p>

        <h2>Options on Today's Events Page&#160;</h2>
        <p>The following options are available on the Today's Events page:</p>
        <h3>Scroll&#160;</h3>
        <p>To scroll the list of today’s scheduled events, use the <span class="bold">Scroll Up</span>&#160;and <span class="bold">Scroll Down</span>&#160;arrows at the bottom right side of the page.</p>
        <h3>Filter&#160;</h3>
        <p>To filter the list of the today’s scheduled events, select one or more filter options (Building, Floor, and/or Room Type). The display is dynamically updated as you select the filters.</p>
        <h3>Find Event&#160;</h3>
        <p>To search for a specific event, click <span class="bold">Find Event Name</span> to open the Event Search page.</p>

        </p>
        <p>Enter your search criteria in the Event Name field, and then click&#160;<span class="bold">Search</span>. You return to the Today’s Events page with the list of events that meet your search criteria displayed on the page.&#160;The search is limited to the exact order of the characters in the string but the string can be found anywhere in the search results and it is not case-sensitive. For example, a search string of “work” returns both EMS&#160;Workplace Training and&#160;Workspace as event names.</p>
        <p>After you have carried out a search, you can click the <span class="bold">Cancel </span>icon,&#160;next to Search Value on the Today’s Events page, to return to the default display (all of today’s scheduled and/or canceled events) for the page.</p>
        <h3>View Map&#160;</h3>
        <p>To view a floor map that shows the location of the scheduled event, click the <span class="bold">View Map</span> icon&#160;for the event.</p>
