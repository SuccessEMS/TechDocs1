        <h2>What is Kiosk?&#160;</h2>
        <p>Run on a touch-screen display unit, the EMS Kiosk is a powerful yet easy-to-use digital room sign and interactive tool for reviewing room availability, booking space, searching for a meeting location and more. Mount the unit outside a room and/or make an EMS Kiosk available in a lobby or entryway. Pair with the optional Floor Plan module and give users an added measure of convenience as they see reserved/available space on a facility diagram, making it even easier to find a meeting or a place to hold one.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>You must be licensed for this optional component.&#160; If you are unsure if your organization is licensed for the EMS Kiosk, or if you would like to learn more about it, please contact your Account Executive.</li>
            <li>Please see the Floor Plan Module Installation Instructions&#160;for information on how to install the optional Floor Plan module.</li>
