        <p>The My Reservations page displays all your reservations for today. You might also be able to check yourself into/out of a building from this page, cancel a current reservation from this page, and/or end a reservation early from this page.</p>
        <p>Tip: The following procedure is written from the perspective of a group search; however, depending on how your EMS Kiosk is configured, you might be required to enter a personnel number/employee ID number for your search criteria.</p>
        <ol start="1">
            <li>Click <span class="bold">My Reservations</span>.&#160;A page opens with options for searching for a group/person.<p>Group/Person Search page</p><p><img src="../../../Resources/Images/Kiosk_V44_UG/Working with The My Reservations.png" alt="emsk_MyReservations_image001.png" /></p></li>
            <li>In the Group field, enter your search criteria and then click <span class="bold">Search</span>.&#160;A list of all groups/people that meet your search criteria is displayed.<p>Tip: The search is limited to the exact order of the characters in the string but the string can be found anywhere in the search results, and it is not case-sensitive. For example, a search string of “ed” returns both Anderson, Scott and Evans,&#160;Dean.</p><p>Example of search results for a group/person</p><p><img src="../../../Resources/Images/Kiosk_V44_UG/Working with The My Reservations_1.png" alt="emsk_MyReservations_image002.png" /></p></li>
