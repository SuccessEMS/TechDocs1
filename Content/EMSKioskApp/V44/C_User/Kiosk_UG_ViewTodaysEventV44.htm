        <p>The Today’s Events page in EMS Kiosk&#160;lists&#160;all&#160;the events that are scheduled for today. Typically, the Today’s Events page is the default page (the page that opens first) when you start EMS.</p>

        <p>The following options are available on this page:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>To scroll the list of today’s scheduled events, use the Scroll Up&#160;and Scroll Down&#160;arrows at the bottom right side of the page.</li>
            <li>To filter the list of the today’s scheduled events, select one or more filter options (Building, Floor, and/or Room Type). The display is dynamically updated as you select the filters.</li>
            <li>To search for a specific event, click <span class="bold">Find Event Name</span> to open the Event Search page.<p>Event Search page</p><p><img src="../../../Resources/Images/Kiosk_V44_UG/Viewing Today s Events.png" alt="emsk_TodaysEvents_image004.png" /></p><p>Enter your search criteria in the Event Name field, and then click <span class="bold">Search</span>. You return to the Today’s Events page with the list of events that meet your search criteria displayed on the page.</p><p>Tip: The search is limited to the exact order of the characters in the string but the string can be found anywhere in the search results, and it is not case-sensitive. For example, a search string of “work” returns both EMS&#160;Workplace Training and&#160;Workspace as event names.</p><p>After you have carried out a search, you can click the <span class="bold">Cancel </span>icon&#160;next to Search Value on the Today’s Events page to return to the default display (all of today’s scheduled and/or canceled events) for the page.</p></li>
