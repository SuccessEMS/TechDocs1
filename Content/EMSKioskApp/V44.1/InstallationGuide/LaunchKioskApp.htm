        <p class="box-note"><span class="bold">NOTE</span>:&#160;This section assumes you have already configured profiles in the EMS Desktop Client.</p>
        <ol start="1">
            <li>To launch&#160;the EMS Kiosk App, browse to the URL you set during installation (i.e.,&#160;http://[ServerName]/EMSKiosk).</li>
            <li>The first time you access the page, you will see a Provisioning Page.<div class="TitleandImage"><p class="title">Provisioning Page</p><p><img src="../../../Resources/Images/EMS Kiosk App Install/Installing Upgrading the EMS_9.png" alt="EMSKiosk_StartingEMSKiosk_ProvisioningPage.PNG" class="PDFlarge" /></p></div></li>
            <li>In the&#160;<span class="bold">Name This Kiosk</span>&#160;field,&#160;provide a unique name for this particular Kiosk (e.g.,&#160;3rd&#160;Floor Lobby). This name will help identify this instance in the logfiles.<p class="box-important"><span class="bold">IMPORTANT</span>: Please note that each provisioning instance of the EMS Kiosk App requires a unique name.</p><p>The provisioning screen will only be displayed when the Kiosk instance is not provisioned: when cookies have been cleared on the Kiosk device that was previously provisioned; a second instance of EMS Kiosk App launched on the same device in a browser in incognito mode; or during the required yearly re-provisioning). For example, the Kiosk Name for initial provisioning may be 3rd Floor Lobby_1; the Kiosk Name for 2nd provisioning would be 3rd Floor Lobby_2).</p><ul start="1"><li>If you have configured the EMS&#160;Platform Services for LDAP, you must use LDAP credentials. Otherwise, enter the credentials for an everyday user (formerly known as Web User) in the username and password field. The username is typically your email address, but is ultimately set by the ‘Field Used to Authenticate Everyday User’ parameter in the EMS Desktop Client.<p class="box-note"><span class="bold">NOTE</span>:&#160;If any of your Kiosk profiles use LDAP authentication, the EMS Platform Services must also be configured for LDAP. You would then also use those credentials on the above provisioning screen. The everyday user must have the Web Admin security template assigned to it.</p><div class="TitleandImage"><p class="title">Platform Services User Authentication</p><p><img src="../../../Resources/Images/EMS Kiosk App Install/Installing Upgrading the EMS_10.png" alt="EMSKiosk_StartingEMSKiosk_UserAuthentication.PNG" class="PDFlarge" /></p></div><p class="box-important"><span class="bold">IMPORTANT</span>:&#160;The EMS Kiosk App will remain provisioned for 1 year. For security reasons, it must be re-provisioned on a yearly basis. </p></li></ul></li>
            <li>After entering those credentials, the&#160;Kiosk Profile Selection&#160;screen will appear.<div class="TitleandImage"><p class="title">EMS Kiosk&#160;Profile Page</p><p><img src="../../../Resources/Images/EMS Kiosk App Install/Installing Upgrading the EMS_11.png" alt="EMS Kiosk_StartingEMSKiosk2.0_Profile.png" class="PDFlarge" /></p></div></li>
            <li>Click on a profile. You will be asked to confirm that you want to apply the selected profile. To confirm, click&#160;<span class="bold">Yes, Apply Profile</span>.&#160;You will see two confirmation screens (shown below) before being brought to the home page that you have configured.<div class="TitleandImage"><p class="title">EMS Kiosk Confirm Profile Page</p><p><img src="../../../Resources/Images/EMS Kiosk App Install/Installing Upgrading the EMS_12.png" alt="EMS Kiosk_StartingEMSKiosk2.0_ConfirmProfile.png" class="PDFlarge" /></p></div><p><img src="../../../Resources/Images/EMS Kiosk App Install/Installing Upgrading the EMS.jpg" alt="EMSKiosk_StartingEMSKiosk_Confirmation2.PNG.jpg" /></p><p><img src="../../../Resources/Images/EMS Kiosk App Install/Installing Upgrading the EMS_1.jpg" alt="EMSKiosk_StartingEMSKiosk_Confirmation3.PNG.jpg" /></p></li>
